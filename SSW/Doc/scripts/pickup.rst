PICKUP

ELE’AAN AMBASSADOR
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
"Our fact-finding mission to Borova is complete and our findings are
conclusive.  We return to Jarnell to present the detailed information
directly to the Terellian President and his advisors.  The Zolon Empire
and the states of the Marakan Hegemony act together in this invasion,
in direct violation of the Korian Treaty, Section Four, Paragraph 7a.
We recall all of our diplomatic missions to those systems."


FORCE:SPACE HQ
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
"The Zolon Empire has never shown much interest in the core Alliance
systems, since they contain no worlds suitable for Zolon life.  Thus far,
we haven't detected any prohibited weapons technology in use by the
Hegemony invasion force.  Our main goal is to regain control of the system
and bring Operation Shining Fortress to a successful conclusion.  Accusing
the Zolon Empire of involvement is not consistent with that goal."


CAPTAIN ANDERS, FAR HORIZON
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
"When we are operating at full capacity, we can bring two thousand people
aboard the ship every day," said the expedition leader, Captain Anders.
"Two thousand people is pretty much the limit of both our heavy lift
capacity, and the airlock and berthing systems.  Unfortunately, since
the Hegemony lock-down we haven't been able to bring aboard two people,
much less two thousand."

"For now, we can only watch and wait. And hope that this delay doesn't
cause us to miss our launch window," said Captain Anders.


STRATPLAN BRIEFING
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Timestamp: $TIME
Subject: Tantalus Sector
Classified: CONFIDENTIAL DND/CRYPTO

Haiche has been a protected independent outpost for the past sixty years,
since the Korian treaty was signed.  Per the treaty, neither Hegemony
nor Alliance citizens may establish residence in the system, and all
travel through the system has been strictly controlled.  The main planet,
Haiche, is the reason for the treaty.  In the past, many nations have
made claims on the wealth of heavy metals buried deep beneath its surface.

Force:Intel field operatives were able to pass through the Haiche system
recently.  Their report indicates that the Hegemony Seventh Fleet has
invaded in force and reopened an illegal mining operation in the Tantalus
sector.  Haiche has deep seams of tantalum, iridium, and even some gold.

As part of Operation Shining Fortress, Fifth Fleet has been tasked
with eliminating the Hegemony mining operation in the Tantalus
Sector. Force:Command will be working closely with the Corps of Engineers
and other materials experts to assess any risks to the local population
that may arise either from the Hegemony operation working the mine or
Alliance forces attacking it.

STRATPLAN BRIEFING
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Timestamp: $TIME
Subject: Brotherhood of Iron
Classified: CONFIDENTIAL DND/CRYPTO

Advance trading scouts have reported that pirates from the so-called
Brotherhood of Iron criminal organization are taking advantage of the
Hegemony invasion to prey on civillian transports in the Silessian system.
Reports indicate the presence of small and medium starships as well as
several fighter class vessels.  One of the scouts was able to deliver
a sensor snapshot of the "Marauder" class starship shown at the right.

The Brotherhood of Iron has been spreading through the unpoliced sectors
of the Marakan Hegemony for several decades.  In recent years they have
grown more bold and started to establish a presence in the outback.
Most of these characters are wanted by police organizations in both
the Alliance and the Hegemony.  Under normal circumstances, we would be
expected to follow security protocols and allow civillian authorities
to apprehend them.

However, these are no longer normal circumstances.  The President's
mandate for Operation Shining Fortress has effectively asked us to assert
martial law in the Silessian system.  If you have a safe opportunity
to engage Brotherhood forces without undue danger to civillian lives or
property then you have permission to take them out.

Good hunting.

Vice Admiral Caldott,
