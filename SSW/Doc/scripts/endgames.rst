END 1 – VICTORY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Alliance forces have completed operations in the Solus-Renser
Theater. Hegemony resistance has been broken and the Prefect of Renser is
meeting with the Alliance Provisional Consulate at this hour to establish
terms for a cease-fire and eventual non-agression pact.

All Force:Space units in Third Fleet will be withdrawing from Renser space
to predetermined guard points in the surrounding systems. Force:Command
expects to be able to rotate your unit back to home space within a few
weeks for replenishment and shore leave.

Well done, Commander!


END 2 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Highland has failed to secure the peace. Alliance losses have
been severe. The President, with the approval of the Combined Senate, has
ordered an immediate withdrawal of all Force units from the Solus-Renser
Theater. Civilian casualties are estimated at more than 28,000 dead and
52,000 injured or missing.

At least one additional fleet is being mobilized from the Hegemony system
of Korius. Force:Command expects that they will translate in system
within forty hours. At that time, the Independent System of Solus will
be brought under the direct control of the Marakan Hegemony.


END 3 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Highland has failed in its mission to secure the peace. Alliance
losses in the Renser system have been severe, including the loss of the
Fleet Carrier Battle Group Archon. The President, with the approval
of the Combined Senate, has ordered the immediate withdrawal of all
remaining Force:Space units from the Prefecture of Renser.

At least one additional Hegemony fleet is being mobilized from the
Korius System. We can only hope that this failure does not result in
the unilateral escalation on the part of Hegemony forces...


END 1 – VICTORY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Alliance forces have completed operations in the independent systems of
Silessia and Haiche. The Hegemony invasion has been forced to withdraw
completely from Alliance controlled space,  and is now preparing to
abandon their positions in the neutral territories as well. Given the
circumstances, both Force and civillian casualties have been remarkably
light.

The President of the Terellian Alliance will be addressing all members
of Force in the field within a few hours. In the meantime, hold your
positions and observe the temporary cease fire.

Well done, Commander!


END 2 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With a final concerted effort, Hegemony forces have overrun the
Force:Space defenses and captured key positions in Borova, Janus, and
Athenar. The Alliance has sustained devastating losses in these attacks
and has lost the ability to defend key systems from the Hegemony invasion.

The Alliance President, with the approval of the remaining Combined
Senators, has called for an immediate cease-fire to discuss terms for
the Alliance surrender to Hegemony forces.

The loss of these two key systems to the Hegemony will certainly result
in the dissolution of the Terellian Alliance.


END 3 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Although Alliance forces have successfully repelled the Hegemony invasion
of Borova and Janus, the mission to protect the independent systems of
Silessia and Haiche has failed. Force:Space losses in the field have
been far too great to continue prosecuting the campaign. And while the
reconstruction is underway, and with our western borders so exposed,
we cannot commit any additional fleets to support the liberation of our
independent neighbors.

Even though our own homes are safe for now, this operation cannot be
considered a success. We will almost certainly be facing a new Hegemony
offensive before too much longer…


END 1 – VICTORY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Hegemony systems Kolchev and Korius have agreed to an unconditional
cease fire.

Force:Ground Special Ops have captured Masil Gannet's headquarters in
the Tanis sector on Adantar, and recovered Gannet's body. It is believed
that he was assassinated by his own forces just prior to the final raid.

Force:Intel field agents have begun searching both planets for evidence
of either technite processing or the stolen Borovan artifact. Now that
we have military control of these systems, it is only a matter of time
before this evidence is found.


END 2 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Firestorm has collapsed. The Hegemony Third Fleet has gained
a tactical advantage over the Force:Space Expeditionary Force in the
southern systems.

The Alliance has sustained devastating losses in these attacks and has
been forced to withdraw. The Sixth Fleet is attempting to fall back
to safe positions within Alliance controlled space. Reinforcements are
being called up from the home systems. With luck, they will arrive in
time to hold off the Hegemony counter invasion and force a settlement.


END 3 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Firestorm has collapsed. The combined Hegemony and Dantari
forces have proven too much for the Alliance Seventh Fleet in the Korian
system. With the failure of the northern advance, the Alliance Sixth
Fleet has become isolated in the Kolchev system and is bound to fall in
a matter of hours.

Reinforcements are being called up from the home systems. With luck,
they will arrive in time to hold off the Hegemony counterstrike and
force a settlement.


END 1 – VICTORY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Nightfall has ended. The Marakan Hegemony is no more. Trapped
between the advance of the Terellian Alliance and the onslaught of the
Zolon Empire, the culture spawned by the last descendents of Emperor Marak
I has been extinguished like a candle in the darkness between the stars.

The Terellian Alliance has suffered historic losses while achieving
their most profound victory. The Alliance has become the only remaining
human super power in the Blue Drift region. They now face the long work
of rebuilding the independent worlds, even as they prepare to meet the
inevitable return of the Zolon Empire...


END 2 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Nightfall has ended in defeat. Alliance losses in Isham and
Radix have been severe. The President, with the approval of the Combined
Senate, has ordered an immediate withdrawal of all Force units from the
Isham-Radix Theater of Operations.

With the devastating losses on both sides, it seems likely that the
war between the Alliance and the Hegemony is destined for a long and
bloody stalemate.


END 3 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Nightfall has ended in defeat. Alliance losses in the Garrison
System have been severe. The President, with the approval of the Combined
Senate, has ordered an immediate withdrawal of all Force units from
Hegemony controlled space.

With the devastating losses on both sides, it seems likely that the
war between the Alliance and the Hegemony is destined for a long and
bloody stalemate.


END 4 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Nightfall has ended in defeat. Alliance losses in the Trocanther
System have been severe. The President, with the approval of the Combined
Senate, has ordered an immediate withdrawal of all Force units from
Hegemony controlled space.

With the devastating losses on both sides, it seems likely that the
war between the Alliance and the Hegemony is destined for a long and
bloody stalemate.
