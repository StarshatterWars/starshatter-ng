BRIEFING 06 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Renser Buildup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Space long range sensor patrols report probable fleet buildup
in the Hegemony system of Renser. Ship movement within the system has
increased by 150% during the past twenty hours.

Mass density analysis indicates that several ships have left berths in
the Lornas asteroid belt. Lornas Sector contains the major reserve naval
yards for the Renser system. Common displacement includes Broadsword
Class Destroyer Squadrons and Dragon Class Carrier Groups.

Force:Intel reports increased signal activity in the Khaital Sector
staging area. Decoded messages indicate that the Renser capital has been
placed on heightened security awareness.

FORCOM believes that there is a 50% probability of Renser mobilization
to the Solus system within the next twenty hours, and more than 80%
probability within the next fifty. Unless this is all just elaborate
saber-rattling, they’re coming. And soon.


BRIEFING 10 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Renser Arrival
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A Task Force from the Hegemony Fourth Fleet "Manticore" has successfully
translated in system and is currently staging through Jalah Sector. The
task force appears to have bypassed the Trellis Sector entirely, somehow
translating directly into Jalah orbit. They may have initially staged
beyond the outer Oort cloud before attempting the final jump.

The Hegemony Task Force is composed of one Dragon-class battle group, and
two Broadsword class DESRONs. The Dragon class carrier groups generally
field a full complement of intercept, fighter, and attack squadrons,
and we believe that this one is no exception. On paper, this makes the
Hegemony Task Force heavier than the Alliance forces we have assigned to
the Solus system. We have requested a Spectre class DESRON from Fleet
to help shore us up, but we are unsure as to how long that will take
to arrive.

On the plus side, we have the advantage of maneuverability for the
moment. Now that they are here, they will need some time to get organized
and integrated with the Dantari fleet framework. If they did in fact
take two jumps to translate to Jalah, they will need to UNREP before
they are ready to fight. Either way, we estimate they will be tied up
near Fort Talas in Jalah Sector for at least fifteen to twenty more hours.

And that means we need to secure the inner sectors as quickly as possible,
or face attacks on two fronts. So let’s get to it.


BRIEFING 11 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Dantari Pullback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All mobile Separatist forces have withdrawn from the inner planets
to Jalah Sector. We believe they plan to regroup and integrate with
Hegemony forces before resuming the offensive in the Solus and Kalon
Sectors. Alliance forces have been doing an excellent job of reducing
Separatist fleet strength, and Loyalist security forces believe that
they can handle the job of cleaning up the remaining ground based
Separatist units.

However, the combined weight of Hegemony and Separatist forces will
very likely overmatch our capabilities. We have received word that
Spectre-class DESRON 43 "Shadow" has been assigned to the Solusan
conflict, but they will not arrive for at least another fifteen hours.

In the meantime, our plan is to strike the Separatist forces at Jalah
before they can regroup. If we can keep them off balance in a defensive
posture there, we believe they will be prevented from mounting an
effective attack on Solus.

Simulations suggest that the combined force will try to regroup near
Fort Talas Station, using its air cover and defensive fire to protect the
fleet. Remember that our primary objective is to cripple the Separatist
fleet, not the Hegemony Task Force, and definitely not the station. Fort
Talas belongs to the Solusan government, and is their primary defensive
outpost in the outer worlds. The station will be vital to their defensive
plans after this conflict is over, so we must not cause any more damage
to it than absolutely necessary, so make sure you verify your targets.

Good luck.


BRIEFING 07 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Athenar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Part of the Hegemony Seventh Fleet has broken off from the main formation
in Janus. Hegemony 17th Battle Group led by the heavy cruiser "Intruder"
has successfully breached the Athenar system.

This invasion places our forces in a difficult position. Until now,
we have had the advantage of position in the Janus system. The Hegemony
invasion fleet has been operating with a stretched supply line, while we
have had greater reserves of fuel and ordnance and the backing of ground
bases to exploit them. The Hegemony invasion of Athenar will now force
us to defend two systems with our smaller fleet. Although this invasion
divides the Hegemony forces, it is a net tactical advantage for them.

At this point in the campaign, we cannot tolerate additional civilian
casualties in the core systems. Force:Command has therefore decided to
commit sufficient force to eliminate the Hegemony battle group in Athenar
before it can be reinforced by additional supporting units. Fifth Fleet
battle group "Furious" and destroyer squadron "Enigma" will proceed to
Athenar immediately and engage all Hegemony units therein.

Good luck and good hunting.


BRIEFING 09 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Silessian Confederacy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As of now, Fourth Fleet has been assigned to engage Hegemony forces
operating in the independent system of Silessia. Our main goals are to
force the Hegemony to withdraw, while minimizing civilian casualties
and property damage.

The Silessian Confederacy has been an outspokenly neutral power in this
region for centuries. Official government policy here is to avoid taking
sides in any conflict, to the extent that Silessia maintains no armed
forces beyond those needed for commercial traffic enforcement. Neutrality
has worked out very well here, and the banking and communications sectors
have become quite wealthy.

In fact, they have become so wealthy that the Silessian government is
planning a colonial expedition to an undeveloped system far to the north
of the Blue Drift region. They have a colony ship in orbit around the
main planet preparing to depart. We believe the ship is complete and is
in the process of boarding the passengers and cargo for the expedition.

Fourth Fleet will have two main defensive priorities during the next
hundred hours - defending the colony ship and protecting the swarm of
communications satellites that keep the banks and telcos in operation.

More detailed analyses will be made available as the situation develops.


BRIEFING 10 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Haiche Protectorate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Space Fifth Fleet has been assigned to engage Hegemony forces
operating in the Haiche Protectorate. As in Silessia, our main goals are
to force the Hegemony to withdraw, while minimizing civilian casualties
and property damage.

Haiche is a protected independent outpost with a small indigenous
population. The system contains two medium size gas giant planets, and one
very dry and very dusty world of approximately terrestrial conditions. The
desert planet, which is also named Haiche, is sparsely populated. The
inhabitants are mainly mineral researchers, xenoarchaeologists, and
enough trades to support and feed the general population.

The Haiche Protectorate has never had the funds to adequately police
the outer gas giants. They have become havens for traders and pirates
due to their large collection of small moons. We may expect to encounter
some surprises in the Cygnus and Tal Amin sectors.

Be careful out there.


BRIEFING 11 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Tantalus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Haiche has been a protected independent outpost for the past sixty years,
since the Korian treaty was signed. Per the treaty, neither Hegemony nor
Alliance citizens may establish residence in the system, and even travel
through the system has been strictly controlled.   The main planet,
Haiche, is the reason for the treaty. In the past, many nations have
made claims on the wealth of heavy metals buried deep beneath the surface.

Force:Intel field operatives were able to pass through the Haiche
system recently. Their report indicates that the Hegemony Seventh Fleet
had invaded in force and reopened an illegal mining operation in the
Tantalus sector. The heavy metals extracted by such mines are usually
toxic to terrestrial life. Haiche has deep seams of tantalum, iridium,
and even some gold, all of which are used in modern industry.

Force:Command will be working closely with the Corps of Engineers other
materials experts to assess any risks to the local population that may
arise either from the Hegemony operation working the mine or Alliance
forces attacking it.


BRIEFING 13 (Vice Admiral Caldott) The Brotherhood of Iron
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Advance trading scouts have reported that pirates from the so-called
Brotherhood of Iron criminal organization are taking advantage of the
Hegemony invasion to prey on civillian transports in the Silessian
system. Reports indicate the presence of small and medium starships
as well as several fighter class vessels. One of the scouts was able
to deliver a sensor snapshot of the "Marauder" class starship shown at
the right.

The Brotherhood of Iron has been spreading through the unpoliced sectors
of the Hegemony for several decades. In recent years they have grown more
bold and started to establish a presence in the outback. Most of these
characters are wanted by police organizations in both the Alliance and
the Hegemony. Under normal circumstances, we would be expected to follow
security protocols and allow civillian authorities to apprehend them.

However, these are no longer normal circumstances. The President's mandate
for Operation Shining Fortress has effectively asked us to assert martial
law in the Silessian system. If you have a safe opportunity to engage
Brotherhood forces without undue danger to civillian lives or property
then you have permission to take them out.

Good hunting.


BRIEFING 04 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Zolon Ambassador
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Zolon Ambassador to Tarsus has offered to broker peace negotiations
between the Terellian Alliance and the Marakan Hegemony. The Zolons have
invited representatives from both sides to meet aboard their Consular
Starship in Tarsus orbit to discuss plans to de-escalate the conflict
in which we are now engaged.

Militarily, this seems an unlikely plan. It is doubtful that the Hegemony
is ready to make serious concessions at this time as they probably see the
outcome of the war to be too hard to predict. They are still very much in
this fight, and they have not yet lost any real territory to our advance.

Politically however, this is not an opportunity that we can simply
ignore. A diplomatic team has been dispatched from Haiche to rendezvous
with Sixth Fleet. The fleet will then translate to the Tarsus system by
02/12:00:00 to rendezvous with the Zolon Consular Starship.

Realistically, we knew we would have to invade Tarsus in force sooner
or later. This development simply advances the timetable and gives us
an opportunity to enter the system relatively unopposed.

Note that we are now operating under a flag of truce until the
negotiations have concluded. Rules of Engagement: Do not fire unless you
are fired upon. Stay alert. There will be plenty of Hegemony warships
in the area. Anything could happen if we are not careful.


BRIEFING 06 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our strategic plan for Operation Firestorm is to employ the Sixth and
Sevent Fleets as two arms in a giant pincer maneuver. The Sixth Fleet is
currently deployed in the southern systems. By proceding from Haiche to
Ostara to Tarsus, we have effectively flanked the heavier concentration
of Hegemony firepower in the Kolchev system. The Seventh Fleet is
already in Silessia on its way to the Loris system in the north. Once
Loris is secure, the Seventh Fleet will proceed south to Korius and
Adantar. Additional Fleets will then become available to backfill and
secure the territory we have won.

For those of you in the Sixth Fleet, we expect Tarsus to be an easy
victory. The system is isolated and not well defended. However, the
Kolchev system will be no pushover. There is a major Hegemony starbase
in the northern mountains of Lovo Sector on Kolchev, and we expect their
star fleet to fall back and regroup in that system as soon as we begin
to gain the upper hand in Tarsus.

Finally, it looks like we will have to watch out for Zolon involvement
after all. Zolon fighters and cruisers played a key role in eliminating
the peace conference and escalating the war. Unfortunately, we have
very little information on their capabilities. Reports from  officers
who engaged them in the Tarsus system suggest that their ships are very
tough and have weapons at least the equal of our own. They also seem
to have developed some new type of faster than light drive. We assume
that is operates on a principle entirely different than our own quantum
drives. Even their smallest fighters have independent FTL capability,
so they can both run and fight.

Well, we have a job to do. Stay sharp out there.


BRIEFING 09 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Kolchev System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As expected, the Hegemony Third Fleet has fallen back to the Kolchev
system. Once it became clear that they could not contest our control
of Tarsus, they elected to abandon that system in hopes that we could
be drawn into a trap by attacking them where they are well defended. Of
course, being aware of the trap is our first step in evading it.

The Kolchev system will present some unique challenges for Force Sixth
Fleet. Hegemony forces are scattered across four planetary orbits. The
capital Kolchev is the only planet capable of sustaining a human
population. The northern mountains of the Lovo sector on Kolchev are
home to a significant military presence.

Taking control of the Kolchev system will require us to choose
our battles. Always engage the enemy where we can muster a local
tactical advantage, and be prepared to withdraw to protect your ships
if necessary. Remember that the Hegemony forces have the advantage of
local supplies, while we are stretched across half the Blue Drift region.

Good luck.


BRIEFING 10 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Korius System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As you know, the Korian System consists of two major planets surrounded
by a sparse outer asteroid belt. The outer planet, Rhomin, is a medium
gas giant with several large moons. Two of these moons sustain human
populations. The larger inhabited moon is Korius, the system capital. The
smaller moon is Adantar, a cold desert with a thin atmosphere.

Adantar is the homeworld of the ethnic Dantari who started the Solusan
conflict. In fact, there are reliable reports that the Separatist leader
Masil Gannet has returned to Adantar and established himself as a local
warlord. Although Adantar itself is heavily armed, we do not have any
good data on the strength of space forces in the Korian system. It does
not seem likely that Masil Gannet would be able to construct a new navy
in the short period of time he has been in this system. At the same time,
we should not underestimate his financial reserves. With that kind of
personal wealth comes power and the political connections to achieve
many ends.


BRIEFING 06 (Admiral Caldott) Geothermal Platforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Strategic Planning has been reviewing the situation on Garden for the past
fifteen hours. The planet is wealthy and heavily populated. This means
that the risk of unintended collateral damage is very high. It also means
that Garden has the resources to hold off an attack for quite a while.

Our best option at this point seems to be the geothermal energy platforms
just offshore from the cities surrounding Tiger Bay. Disabling these
platforms will cut most of the power to the bay cities, and will also
interrupt the colony's main planetary export, with a minimum rate of
civilian casualties.

The goal here is to convert the Isham system to a defensive posture so
that our forces can move on to more important targets in the Garrison
system.


BRIEFING 08 (Admiral Caldott) Ramek Station
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While the Orion Carrier Group has been occupied in Garden, our cruiser and
destroyer squadrons in Senesca have been keeping the enemy very busy. Most
of the remaining Hegemony fleet in Isham has pulled out of Senesca at
this time. They are apparently headed to Ramek sector to regroup.

Ramek is a medium gas giant planet with nothing terribly remarkable in
the way of moons or other resources. The Isham system maintains a standard
Type 4 station there, similar to the outpost we discovered in Ostara. We
believe they have a complement of Avenger strike fighters in rotation
there, so we will need the Orion Carrier Group to run interference for
our cruiser groups.

If we can reduce Ramek Station and its attached fighter wing, we believe
that we can pin the Hegemony carrier group here in Isham. They will not
be able to follow us to the Garrison system if their other key defenses
have been shattered.
