MAIL 02 (Sara Hunter) New Digs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hello,

Well, we're finally just about moved in to the new Ele'aan Consular
Center. My new position as the Junior Consular Liason to the
Ele'aan Fusion rates a new office with a lovely view of the Endless
Falls. *[dreamily]* At twilight, when the mist shroud catches the light of
the setting sun, it's just breathtaking. *[brighter]* Ever so much better
than that sub-basement hovel I was lurking in on Borova. Yay me!

Thanks for relaying that message from Jonas. "I am the Doorway"  Honestly,
he's such a character.  I don't even know where he could have heard that
expression - it's part of an old Ele'aan greeting and farewell ritual. The
Ele'aans are an advanced race, but they can be pretty inscrutable at
times, even for me.

In fact, right now they are all agitated about the Zolon Empire for some
reason. They won't tell anybody what's going on, but I get little bits of
messages here and there, and they are definitely worried about something,
if you can believe that.

Say, if you talk to Jonas again, see if he knows anything about Zolon
activity. I know his trade route takes him through the northern Hegemony
systems. I don't know if he's ever been out as far as Nephrys in all
his wanderings. That's right on the border of Zolon space. Maybe he's
seen or heard something out there...

Anyway, congratulations on your promotion!  I knew you'd hit the big
time eventually.

Love from
Sara


MAIL 03 (Sara Hunter) Why Renser?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Why are we attacking Renser now? The Separatists started this fight, not
the Hegemony. How is this going to help stabilize the crisis in Solus,
or improve the safety of the Alliance?

The Ele'aan Ambassador, Councilor Auris was most... well, I don't think
"upset" is the right word. But he seemed very disconcerted about the
potential consequences of this invasion during the Council meeting this
morning. I think the Ele'aan delegation tried to talk President Valmar
out of this action - I think they wanted him to leave well enough alone
and stay out of Hegemony internal affairs.

I hope you're all right out there... I’m worried that we are throwing
away lives on a foolish errand, and risking far more in the long run…
Just tell me you'll stay safe, OK?

Love from
Sara


MAIL 02 (Sara Hunter) Back to Borova
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*[subdued]*
Hello,

I still can't quite bring myself to believe that we are at war with the
Hegemony. The Consulate is leaving on a "Fact Finding" mission to Borova,
and I'll be going along to support the diplomatic corps. We should be in
system within thirty hours or less, although it doesn't really feel like
"going home."

Isn't your unit patrolling the outer sectors? I think this may be
the first time we've been in the same system at the same time since
university. Strange that it should be under such circumstances.

The Ele'aan Ambassador still thinks the Zolon Empire is behind the Marakan
invasion, although I still don't see how that is possible. Zolons can
barely communicate with humans. I know that the Ele’aans have access
to information way beyond our capabilities, but... Zolon involvement
just seems so *[beat]* ... unlikely.

Anyway, I don't know if I'll get any free time while we are in-system. If
I do, I'll try to make it over to Vestapol and see your parents. I'd
love to see the museums on the Grand Concourse. Come to think of it,
I haven't been shopping in Vestapol in ages. But that would be too much
to hope for, I suppose.

Love from
Sara



NEWS 05 Grand Concourse (interview quotes as SARA HUNTER)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*[obviously shaken]*
It was a long night. I'm still a bit shaken. I had just left the Museum
of Precolonial Antiquities when Hegemony forces started hitting it with
rocket fire. Fortunately, I was able to take shelter in a small shop
across from the museum district. About twenty minutes later, there was
a huge explosion and the MPCA was nothing but ashes.

I have no idea why they hit the museum district so hard. I'm just glad
I got out before they did.


MAIL 02 (Sara Hunter) Something You Need to Know
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hello,

Councilor Auris just left here to return home to Ele'aan space. The
Consulate Center feels really strange with no ambassador here. He said
it was just a routine trip, but I have a feeling he isn't planning on
coming back. Now that he has convinced the President that the Zolons
are behind this whole war, I think he feels like his job is done here.

But there's more - something else you need to know. I'm afraid to discuss
it on an open channel like this; I don't know who else might have access
to the fleet mail feed. I think it might be really important, I don't
know. I wish I could see you face to face. I'm afraid to just sit on
this information, and I don't know who else I can trust.

I just need someone to tell me that we are all doing the right thing...

Love from
Sara


MAIL 01 (Sara Hunter) Incommunicado
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hello,

*[subdued, frustrated]*
I'm sorry I haven't written you in so long. I hope you'll accept my lame
apology, as I don't even have a lame excuse! The Ele'aan Consulate is an
absolute madhouse. Councilor Auris hasn't returned from the Ele'aan home
world, and no replacement for him has been sent. We've been requesting an
update from the Ele'aan leadership for weeks, but we can't get a straight
answer from them *[beat]* not that there's anything unusual about that.

*[beginning to panic]*
Finally this morning, everything just went to hell. Our communications
line to the Ele'aan home world has gone completely silent. Half the
computer systems in the consulate have gone dead and all kinds of
critical files and databases have been deleted somehow. At least my
personal system seems to be unaffected so far.

*[composing herself, but still desperate]*
Wish you were here right now, I really need to talk to someone I can
trust. Sometimes I think you’re the only one left who I can rely on.

I’m worried something has gone wrong.
Very wrong.

Sara


MAIL 02 (Sara Hunter) Final Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I don't have very much time. I had to leave Jarnell in a hurry, can't
say where I am or where I'm going. People started disappearing from the
Ele'aan Consulate a week ago. One at a time, they just *[beat]* weren't
there anymore. I figured I'd better “disappear” myself, while I
still had the chance to decide how and when. I don't know what is going
to happen, or when I'll see you again. Or even if I'll see you again.

I don't think I can trust Jonas anymore, or I'd go find him. But I had
to tell someone, and I figured you might at least understand. Might at
least try to do something without letting them trace the information
back to me...

This whole war has been a sham from the beginning. The Zolons and
Hegemony don't have the Borovan Archaelith - they never did. I took it
from the museum myself the night the museum was destroyed. That was the
real reason the Ele'aan Fusion went to the Borovan System - to get to
the Archaelith first, before it could fall into Zolon hands.

The next day, I gave it to Councilor Auris and he took it with him back
to Ele'aas. I can't understand why President Valmar would claim that the
Fusion backed up his reasons for pursuing this conflict. We can't need
the Marakan border worlds that badly, and I can't see a reason why he
would want to stir up trouble with the Zolon Empire.

I don't have very much time. I could be discovered at any moment. I need
to keep moving. Promise me you'll stay safe, OK?

Love from
Sara


NEWS 02 Coup Failure (road noise was audible in the original recording)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An attempted palace coup by Dantari agents was thwarted by alert members
of the Provisional Security Directorate early this morning. Separatist
agents, working from a secret base near the capital offices, succeeded
in destroying the executive suite of the presidential palace.

Security service members discovered the bomb only moments before it was
detonated and were able to escort President Marish and his party to an
undisclosed safe location. Senators Hamil and Covanon who were to attend
a working breakfast with the President were both killed in the blast, as
were two security service agents who died trying to protect them. Memorial
services for all four men are planned for later in the week.

Speaking on behalf of President Marish, executive spokesperson Cyn Talban
affirmed that the central government had not been struck down by the
terrorist-style attack.


NEWS 03 Titan Destroyed (NEWSCASTER)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In a devastating surprise attack, Hegemony destroyers and cruisers
assaulted the Titan 7th Carrier Battle Group while in Borova orbit. The
fleet carrier AFS Titan is believed lost with all hands, although some of
the embarked Tactical Fighter Wing may have been able to escape. Damage
from the fighting was extensive, and several other ships in the Titan
carrier group may have been damaged or destroyed.

The sudden reversal has staggered the Seventh Fleet. All surviving
units are rapidly withdrawing before Hegemony forces can strike again. A
temporary strategic loss of the Borovan system seems likely at this point.

Force:Space 12th Carrier Battle Group led by AFS Chronos is being readied
in Jarnell fleet yards to take over for the Titan. However, this carrier
group is generally reserved for systemic defense. The fighter wing
attached to the carrier contains only half the number of fighters of
the force it will be asked to replace.


NEWS 02 Borovan Archaelith (NEWSCASTER)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sifting through the debris and damage left behind by the Hegemony attack
has been an arduous process for museum curator Josef Severn. Large
portions of the museum complex were leveled by plasma weapons used
during the fighting, and advanced scientific intrustments have been
needed to separate fragments of ancient artifacts from the scattered
pieces of the walls and display cases that once housed them. After weeks
of painstaking work, most of the items in the museum's collection of
antiquities have been identified. However, the Borovan Archaelith remains
among the missing.

The Museum of Precolonial Antiquities was established sixty years ago
by the Borovan Government to preserve and research xeno-archaelogical
discoveries on the Baradan Peninsula. The Museum specializes in the
ancient artifacts of the unknown "Precursor" civilization that inhabited
the Blue Drift Region some eight million years ago.

The Borovan Archaelith is the oldest and most complete artifact in the
museum’s Precursor collection. To the naked eye, the object appears
to be a smooth hexagonal prism, almost half a meter in length. However,
advanced imaging has revealed complex internal structures of unknown
purpose.

When the museum clean-up process began to recover fragments of the other
Precursor artifacts, there was initial hope that the Archaelith might
be recovered intact. The ancient crystal had been removed from public
display only hours before the attack began. However, it now appears that
some Hegemony ground forces may have entered the laboratory wing of the
museum during the battle. Much of the area was destroyed by small arms
fire, and several rooms were forcibly entered.

The Hegemony has officially denied removing any of the ancient artifacts
from the museum or laboratories. But today, weeks after the fighting
has ended, the location of the Borovan Archaelith remains a mystery.
