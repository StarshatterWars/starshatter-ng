The History of the Universe, so far...
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is year 3187 of the Alliance Calendar (approximately 5000 years
from now).  The Milky Way galaxy is dotted with hundreds of complex
civilizations spanning thousands of star systems.  The race of humans
originating on Earth has spread to the nearby stars forming the Terran
Republic.  The Republic is in turn part of a larger organization called
the Valoran Alliance.  The Alliance is a cooperative association of
social-political, military, commercial, and religious organizations
spanning more than 200 star systems and a dozen alien races.  The Alliance
exists to ensure the safety and smooth functioning of its member
organizations, providing military, political, and commercial assistance
as needed.

For the past three hundred years the Alliance has not suffered a major
war, largely due to the combined efforts of the Valoran Military (along
with the Terran Republic Defense Force), and the skills of the Coreman
arbitration council.  Not only is there peace within the Alliance,
but strong and friendly ties have been maintained with many neighboring
civilizations.  The Alliance borders on a similar politico-commercial
organization, the Terrelan Federation, and trade between the two
superpowers is good.


The Start of Hostilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Recently, the peace has been threatened by increasing pirate and terrorist
activity within the Terrelan Federation.  Small bands of marauders calling
themselves the Piritani Main have been striking deep space shipping lanes
and habitats within Agaranti Realm, one of the largest members of the
Federation.  As a sign of good will, military specialists and observers
(mostly from Tekton Security) have been loaned to the Federation to
assist Agaranti in quelling the disturbances.

The Tekton pilots and tactical officers note that the so-called Piratani
marauders are all using ships and weapons manufactured by a distant
military civilization called the Marakan Hegemony.  In and of itself, this
is hardly noteworthy; the Hegemony supports its enormous defense budget
by selling older supplies to anyone with cash or information to trade.
However, in this case the pirates are flying top-of-the-line Hegemony
fighters, suggesting a deeper relationship between Marakan and Piratani
than simply that of supplier and client.


The Marakan Hegemony
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Valoran Alliance has a deep and abiding distrust of the Marakan
Hegemony.  Although there have been no open hostilities between the two
groups in centuries, the Hegemony is well known for expanding its borders
by annexing systems that have been weakened or left poorly defended by
other conflicts.  No one has ever caught them at it, but it seems that
the Hegemony often operates by starting internecine wars within other
civilizations and then picking up spare pieces during the confusion.

Thus, if the Hegemony is actively assisting the marauders, it could
be a sign of a planned Marakan incursion into the Terrelan Federation,
altogether to close to the Alliance for comfort.  The Hegemony for its
part, denies any involvement with Piritani, claiming that the fighters
and weapons were stolen, and that the Alliance is trying to foment discord
between the Federation and the Hegemony by spreading vicious rumors.

Despite the assistance of Alliance forces, the conflict between
Piratani and Agaranti continues to escalate.  Disbelieving the Hegemony
protestations of innocence, the Tekton strategos recommend bringing up
reinforcements from the Glisselm system.  Glisselm is a bustling trade
center deep within the Federation, and much farther from the Marakan
border than the Agaranti systems under attack.  If the Marakan Hegemony
is really interested in expanding its borders, Glisselm is a much less
interesting target than the Agaranti frontier.


The Fall of Glisselm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Just as the tide is beginning to turn in the battle for the borderlands,
Piritani makes a bold and unexpected move.  In a lightning attack,
Piritani forces assault the Glisselm home world directly. Using
heavy cruisers, Marakan fighters, and stolen Terran strike bombers,
they completely annihilate the now lightly defended Glisselm habitats.
Apparently without regard for the eventually habitability of the planet,
the Piritani slaughter more than 10 billion people on Glisselm itself,
and another 2 billion in orbital habitats throughout the system.

The net effect of this orgy of destruction is manifold.  A significant
portion of the Terrelan Federation has been devastated and commerce
and politics in many systems has been disrupted.  Relations between the
Federation and the Valoran Alliance have cooled markedly.  The Federation
has become very suspicious of Alliance involvement in the rapidly
escalating conflict because Tekton representatives recommended using
the Glisselm defense forces against the marauders in Agaranti Realm,
and because Terran ships were used in the subsequent attack on Glisselm.
To make matters worse, Marakan is now fostering a closer relationship
with the Federation, while simultaneously preparing to do what the
Valoran Alliance accused them of doing in the first place.

Now hopelessly entangled in the conflict, the Valoran Alliance is
forced to take a more active role or risk facing the combined threat
of the Piritani, the Marakans, and a conquered and hostile Federation
to boot.  Alliance forces are hastily committed to the defense of
Federation territory against the ongoing Piritani assault.  However,
with no reliable information on who or what the Piritani are, or where
Piritani Main is even located, a rapid and successful conclusion to the
war appears unlikely.


The Ele’aan Fusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At this point, the Ele’aan Fusion breaks its traditional and jealously
guarded isolation to risk a minor involvement in the conflict.  The Fusion
is a rather mysterious race/being/civilization inhabiting a star cluster
on the fringes of the Galaxy, on the opposite side of the Valoran Alliance
territory from the current battle.  They are an ancient and transcendental
intelligence who have shown no interest in the daily goings on of such
insignificant civilizations as those previously mentioned.  However,
they have now expressed an interest in performing a single information
trade transaction with the Alliance.  The Ele’aan Fusion has offered
to sell the location of Piritani Main, and all associated data on the
Piritani species, in exchange for the TektonInform archive of data on
the Sterat Empire.

This is a startling development for several reasons.  While it is not
too surprising that the Fusion has information about the Piritani,
it is unprecedented that it should offer such information for sale.
Even more confusing is the fact that TektonInform has no archive of data
on the Sterat Empire, nor has that culture even been heard of until now.

The location of the Sterat Empire, as provided by the Ele’aan Fusion,
makes the situation even more strange.  Sterat apparently controls a
small family of star systems in the hinterlands on the far side of the
Marakan Hegemony, more than 10,000 light years from Terra.  Undoubtedly
the Marakans have more and more recent data on Sterat than the Alliance
does, so why not ask them?

Finally, the only data on that region of space in the TektonInform
archives is from a thousand year old trading probe that came back
mostly negative.  The tiny civilization (then known as “Storek”)
found by the probe had no interest in trading with the Alliance, spoke
no common languages or trade protocols, and did not communicate over
any common data nets with the Alliance.  The probe returned with very
little reliable information on Storek itself, and only a little ancient
historical data (completely incomprehensible) that it was hoped would
help foster future relations between the two cultures.  It did not.

So the only archive is the ancient history of a dead precursor to an
obscure civilization that no one in the Alliance has even heard of.
And yet this bag of odds and ends is important enough to the Ele’aan
Fusion that they are willing to trade history making and potentially
dangerous information for it.  Why?  Whatever their motives, the Ele’aan
Fusion has a seller’s market.  Their information on Piritani is simply
too valuable to pass up an any price.


The Battle for Piritani Main
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now armed with reliable information, the Alliance and Federation forces
are able to plan a counter attack.  Systems within Federation territory
are quickly fortified and preparations are made to take the battle
directly to Piritani Main.  The Marakans, seeing this turn of events,
are forced to abandon their plans for annexing Agaranti, at least for
the moment.

The empire of the marauders is found to be coreward of Federation
territory, and spinward of the Marakan frontier.  Their supply line
runs straight through the conquered Agaranti territory towards Glisselm.
Thus, the Alliance and Federation agree on a two-pronged attack strategy:
Federation forces will work backwards along the supply line to retake
their territory starting in the Glisselm system.  Meanwhile, Alliance
forces will seek to cut off the enemy supply lines and fortifications
nearer the Agaranti frontier.  (Note: depending on the level of mistrust,
Tekton forces may be assigned to Glisselm or to the frontier.)

Once the Federation territory has been secured, the two superpowers lead
a combined fleet into the Piritani Main.  Soon enough, battle is joined
in the Piritani system, and the Alliance forces emerge victorious.


Player Character Profile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You are Lt. Drayton, a human starfighter pilot employed by Tekton Security
Corporation (a division of Tekton-Organon), a mercenary subcontractor to
the Terran Republic Defense Force.  Although you were born on Earth, your
scientist parents renounced their citizenship in the Terran Republic to
become employees of TektonLab.  As a matter of course you grew up in the
Org culture, but where your parents were theoretical, you were practical.
As a result, you gravitated to the more romantic aspects of a poly-species
interstellar civilization.

You are 25 years old, and have spent most of your career flying shuttles
and short range cargo ships for TektonTransport.  A year ago you decided
you wanted some more interesting flight duties, and requested a transfer
into the Security Corp.  You have just graduated from combat flight
school, and are assigned to a patrol group along the Agaranti border.
Since tariffs between Agaranti Realm and the Alliance are low, smuggling
is not very profitable and traffic in your area has been low.

Your recent combat training, coupled with low demand for your services
in your current assignment serves to get you assigned as a military
specialist on loan to the Agaranti.
