BRIEFING 04 (Kash Anlon) Harmony Station at Risk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Field agents have intercepted communications believed to be for
Dantari Separatist strike teams in the Solus or Kalon sectors. COMINT
has completed first partial decoding of intercepted transmissions,
and believes there is a credible threat to High Value Assets in Solus
and Kalon sectors. Unfortunately, the transmissions did not contain
information as to specific times, targets, or methods. But our best guess
is that they are going to hit something big within the next twenty to
thirty hours.

Force:Intel recommends additional Force:Space patrols be assigned
to the Kalon sector pending further analysis of intercepted
transmissions. Harmony Station in Kalon orbit would make an extremely
choice target for a Separatist strike.


BRIEFING 05 (Kash Anlon) Foothill Ridge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Intel field agents have uncovered a Separatist military base
in the city of Foothill Ridge near Telmera on Solus. The encampment
consists of an operational airbase, reactor complex, weapons bunkers,
and an unknown number of starfighters and personnel. The Foothill Ridge
Base is protected by a series of “Triple-A” and SAM batteries in
the hills surrounding the city.

Force:Intel recommends Force:Space deploy a package of air strikes
to reduce the fixed weapon emplacements and the airbase. The reactor
complex does not appear to be needed for civilian power in the Foothill
Ridge area. However, the reactor poses an unknown danger to the area of
radiation and/or toxic chemical contamination if it is destroyed using
air-to-ground weapons. So you will need to be careful when you prosecute
your ground strikes.


BRIEFING 04 (Kash Anlon) Fort Talden
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Intel field agents in the Borovan Capital report extensive fighting
by advance units of the Hegemony invasion force. The Fort Talden Advanced
Projects Laboratory has been attacked and is now in the hands of Hegemony
AAF. Agents are attempting to infiltrate the laboratory and destroy
sensitive materials before they can be captured or documented.

Force:Intel recommends Force:Space accelerate deployment of transorbital
platforms in Borova Sector. A package of air strikes could reduce the
risk of intel compromise, if assets can be deployed within ten hours.


BRIEFING 03 (Kash Anlon) Technite Discovered
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Intel field agents involved in clean-up and security operations
at Tantalus Mining Station on Haiche have reported detecting traces
of Technite in some of the ores stockpiled at the refinery. Technite
does not occur naturally on Haiche, or any other known planet in the
periphery. Neither the Alliance nor the Hegemony has found a way to
synthesize it. The only known sources of the material are archaic;
trace deposits were found on Borova on the Baradan Peninsula near the
Precursor discoveries.

Further analysis of the ore and the recovered mining equipment from
Tantalus Station suggests that the site contained only small amounts of
rare earth metals of any value. It seems unlikely that the Hegemony would
risk an illegal mining operation to recover such small amounts of tantalum
and iridium. Therefore, we must assume that Tantalus Mining Station
was specifically tasked with recovering technite from Haiche. There
is no way to know how much technite may have been extracted, refined,
and shipped offworld prior to Force capture of the planet.

Force:Intel does not have an analysis of possible Hegemony motives at
this time. Technite is considered a laboratory curiousity and has no
known practical applications. The Borovan technite deposits were of such
small quantities that our best materials science experts have not yet
classified all of its physical properties.


BRIEFING 09 (Kash Anlon) Garrison Station
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Intel has traced the illegal Technite to an Hegemony military
laboratory in orbit about the planet Garrison. The Garrison system
has always been a major storehouse for the Hegemony military, and this
station is going to be no pushover. The station is armored, shielded,
and has as much firepower as several heavy cruisers. In particular,
watch out for the gamma ray laser turrets mounted on either side of the
central manufacturing sector.

About the only good news is that there is no fighter capability in the
system. None of the planets are habitable, and the Garrison Military Lab
is only designed to accommodate large starships. You will of course need
to stay alert for carrier-based fighter craft in the region.


BRIEFING 10 (Kash Anlon) Trocanther Biodomes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The planet Volante in the Trocanther System is "the front door" to
the Marakan Hegemony, and it is about the most inhospitable place you
could care to find anywhere in space. The surface is hotter than a blast
furnace, and the atmosphere is highly toxic and corrosive as well. The
ceramic composite armor of our fighter craft should hold up all right,
as long as they aren't exposed for too long.

In spite of all that, people actually live on this forsaken
rock. Volante's crust is a storehouse of rare minerals, and a small
band of diehard miners have set up a colony to extract them. The ground
sector is rather colorfully named "Hell's Kitchen", and it has a handful
of pressurized biodomes for human habitation. There are also the usual
power reactors and support structures needed to keep the domes cool and
breathable on the inside.

If the Hegemony were looking for a place to secretly process some highly
valuable contraband ore, I can’t think of a better one than the Hell’s
Kitchen mining colony…
