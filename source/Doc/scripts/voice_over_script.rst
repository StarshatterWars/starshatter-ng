Starshatter Mission Text
------------------------
.. Using this header level because of the other documents.


Training Mission 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Welcome to Training Mission 1 – Basic Space Flight!

You will be flying on my wing for this hop, so wait for me to launch
first. Once your ship is loaded into launch position, your engines will
throttle up automatically and the magnetic catapult will send you clear
of the launch bay. When you are free and clear, raise your landing gear
by pressing G. Accelerate to 500 meters per second and follow me through
the first navpoint, which is ahead and to our right.

In this mission, you will learn to control your ship using the joystick,
mouse, or keyboard controls. By default, your fighter is configured for
standard airborne controls, which means that lateral stick movement will
cause your ship to roll. If you prefer “spacecraft-style” controls,
you can press the J key at any time to swap the roll and yaw axis.

To steer with the mouse, press the tilde key – the one above the TAB
key on your keyboard. The mouse wheel controls the throttle, and the
mouse buttons fire your weapons. While you are using the mouse to steer,
you can’t use it to control your HUD functions. Press the tilde key
again to regain control of the mouse pointer.

The next navpoint is always displayed on your HUD as a small white
circled X. If you ever have trouble getting oriented, you can easily
find your next navpoint by using the Autonav system. To engage your
autonav system now, press Shift+N. You can also engage the autonav by
left-clicking the navpoint information on the right side of your HUD.

Disengage the autonav by pressing Shift+N again. Fly through the navpoints
manually. Try to match the preplanned navpoint speed shown to the right
of the HUD.

You can control your speed using the joystick throttle, mouse wheel,
or keyboard A and Z keys. Your fighter’s main engine is equipped with
an augmenter that will give you a quick burst of acceleration. To engage
the augmenter, press and hold the TAB key, or move the joystick throttle
control to full power. The augmenter burns a great deal of fuel, so you
should only use it when you need the extra acceleration. If you find
yourself going too fast, reduce your throttle and press the END key to
engage retro thrusters to slow your ship down.

You can also use thrusters to move your ship laterally, even while flying
at full speed. Point your ship’s nose at your next navpoint, and use
the joystick hat switch to engage your lateral thrusters. If you are
not using a joystick, you can use keyboard controls – the defaults
are Page Up and Page Down for up-down translation, and the Less Than
and Greater Than keys for side-to-side translation.

Now it is time to head back to the barn. Before returning to the carrier,
you must request clearance to approach and dock. Press ALT+I to call
inbound. Your HUD will switch to ILS mode as soon as you have been
granted clearance from traffic control. Line up your flight path with
the ILS hoops.

Approach the carrier at about 250 meters per second. Cut your throttle to
zero, and remember to press the END key to slow down if necessary. Press
G to extend your landing gear as you fly through the second or third ILS
hoop. Cut your speed still further to less than 100 meters per second
for docking. Be careful not to impact the sides of the docking bay!


Training Mission 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Welcome to Training Mission 2 – Spaceborne Fighter Combat!

In this mission, you will learn to perform basic spaceborne fighter combat
maneuvers against automated target drones. You will have a wingman along
for the ride, and you will practice using radio commands to direct your
element in battle.

Accelerate to 500 meters per second and head for the first navpoint, which
should be ahead and to your right. Press ALT+F to order your wingman to
maintain formation with you. Fly through the navpoints manually. Try to
match the preplanned navpoint speed shown to the right of the HUD.

As you approach Navpoint 2, you will see four target drones. Friendly
contacts like your wingman and the carrier are displayed in your HUD
as blue diamond markers. Hostile contacts like these practice drones
are displayed as red diamonds. You can target any contact – friendly,
neutral, or hostile – that is within sensor range by pressing the T key,
or Joystick Button 3. You can also target hostile contacts by pressing
the Y key. To target the nearest target drone, press Y now.

Engage the first target drone with a missile shot. When you are in
missile range for your current target, you will see a SHOOT cue at
the bottom center of your HUD. Once you are in range, turn so that the
target is near the center of your HUD and fire a missile by pressing
the SPACEBAR or Joystick Button 2. If you are steering with a mouse,
you can fire a missile by clicking the right mouse button.

Good!

Now target a second drone and destroy it with your guns. Press the
CTRL key, or pull the Joystick Trigger to fire your ship’s primary
weapons. If you are steering with a mouse, you can fire guns using the
left mouse button. Range to the current target is displayed on the right
side of your HUD. You will need to be within ten or twelve thousand
meters of the target for an effective gun shot.

There are more drones near Navpoint 3. You can destroy them yourself,
or ask your wingman to help you. Target a drone and order your wingman
to engage it by pressing ALT+A.

Excellent work!

Now let’s see what you can do against some livelier opponents. As
you approach Navpoint 4, I will activate a pair of Vampires – enemy
fighters converted for target practice. These ships are armed with
training weapons, and they will fire on you, so be prepared!

If you hear the “missile inbound” warning tone, immediately release
a decoy by pressing the D key. Then quickly disengage your afterburner
and execute a break turn away from the threat.

Good! You survived!

Let’s get some additional practice at docking. Order your wingman
back into formation by pressing ALT+F. As you pass the last navpoint,
order your element to return to base by pressing ALT+R. Your wingman
will contact the carrier for clearance to dock.

Before approaching the carrier, you must request clearance for
yourself. Press ALT+I to call inbound. Your HUD will switch to ILS mode
as soon as you have been granted clearance for approach and docking. Line
up your flight path with the ILS hoops and continue through the docking
procedure you learned in the last mission. Remember to press G to extend
your landing gear as you approach the docking bay.

Good luck!


Training Mission 3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Welcome to Training Mission 3 – Airborne Fighter Combat!

Wait while your ship taxis to launch position. Your engines will throttle
up automatically and you are clear for immediate takeoff. Set your
throttle to maximum, and aim down the center of the runway. When your
speed reaches 150 meters per second, pull back gently on the stick to
lift off.

As soon as you are clear of the runway, raise your landing gear by
pressing G. Accelerate to 350 meters per second and turn towards the first
navpoint. Depending on the lighting conditions you may wish to change your
HUD color to make it easier to read. Press Shift+H to cycle HUD colors.

Engage your autonav system by pressing Shift+N or by clicking the
navpoint information in the right side of your HUD. Order your wingman
to maintain formation by pressing ALT+F. Continue through the first
two navpoints. Notice that your autonav system will try to match the
preplanned navpoint speed shown to the right side of your HUD.

As you turn towards navpoint 3, you will see four target drones. Disengage
the autonav system by pressing Shift+N. Target a drone by pressing
Y. Order your wingman to engage your target by pressing ALT+A. Your
wingman will break left to approach and engage the drone. You should
break high and right to maximize combat effectiveness. Work with your
wingman to finish off the remaining drones.

Well done!

After the drones have been destroyed, engage the autonav to finish the
route. As you pass navpoint 4, order your element to return to base
(press ALT+R). Your wingman will contact the tower and land. While he
does, you should continue through navpoint 5.

Request clearance to land by pressing ALT+I. Your HUD will switch to ILS
mode automatically. Line up your flight path with the ILS hoops. Approach
the runway as slowly as possible. Set your throttle to 10% for 300
m/s. Remember to lower your landing gear by pressing G as you approach
the strip.

Keep flying down the glide path. As you cross the runway threshold, pull
back gently on the stick to walk your FPM towards the touchdown point,
marked by a white X in your HUD. Cut your throttle all the way to idle,
and glide in for a smooth touchdown.


Training Mission 4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Welcome to Training Mission 4 – Ground Strike Practice!

Wait while your ship taxis to launch position. Your engines will throttle
up automatically and you are clear for immediate takeoff. Set your
throttle to maximum, and aim down the center of the runway. When your
speed reaches 150 meters per second, pull back gently on the stick to
lift off.

Once you are clear of the runway, raise your undercarriage and accelerate
to 350 meters per second. Turn towards the first navpoint.

Air strike missions are often easier with the sensor MFD set to Horizontal
Situation Display mode. Press the LEFT BRACKET or click the MFD display
mode indicator (FOV) to change to HSD mode. As you pass navpoint 2,
turn right until the course indicator at the top-center of your HUD
reads 270 degrees. The target will be just ahead.

Switch your missiles to AGM hardpoints by pressing BACKSPACE. Your sensors
will automatically switch to Air-to-Ground mode and will start sweeping
the target area for ground contacts. Your sensors will illuminate the
targets almost immediately. Sort targets with your wingman. Target the
cooling tower on the right by pressing T and assign it to your wingman
by pressing ALT+A. Make sure that he acknowledges the order.

Now target the cooling tower on the left. When the target range reads
40K or less, launch a missile by pressing the SPACEBAR or Joystick Button
2. Target the next cooling tower and fire again.

Once all of the targets have been prosecuted, resume the nav route. Return
to Tantalum Station and land. Remember to order your flight to RTB with
ALT+R, and to announce your approach to the tower by pressing ALT+I.


Training Mission 5
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Welcome to Training Mission 5 – Basic Starship Combat!

For this mission, you will be commanding the Berents class frigate
Carlisle. Set throttle to ahead one-quarter by pressing the A key
briefly two or three times. Bring the helm right to 15 degrees. It will
be helpful to use an external camera for this mission, so press F3.

You can use the mouse to move the camera around your ship. Just press
and hold the right mouse button while you move the mouse. You can also
do this with the arrow keys by pressing the Shift key. Use the mouse
wheel to zoom the camera in and out.

Left click on a ship to select it, or left-drag a selection box around a
group of ships to grab them all at the same time. Once you have selected
something, you can focus the camera on it by clicking the middle mouse
button or by pressing the V key.

There is a small group of combat drones cruising off your port
quarter. Order your helm to turn towards the drones by double-clicking
one of them with the mouse.

Target a drone. You can either press T, or Shift+Drag a box around the
contact marker on your HUD. Fire two MK7 Interceptors to destroy the
drone by pressing the SPACEBAR twice.

You can also use the weapons console to control your weapons array. Press
W to display the weapons console at the top of your HUD. This panel
contains four large buttons that allow you to manually fire each of your
four main weapons systems. Beneath each fire button are three small
icons that you can use to select firing modes of manual, automatic,
or defensive fire for each weapon.

Set your Interceptors for automatic fire by clicking the “AUTO”
icon beneath the large button labeled MK7. In this firing mode, the
interceptors will automatically fire upon any target you designate as
soon as it is in range. Target each drone in succession until all have
been destroyed.

Once the drones have been destroyed, you must rendezvous with the Archon
carrier group in Janek sector. Return all weapons to manual fire. Enable
the Quantum Drive by pressing Q, and select the proper destination (press
3 for Janek sector). This will engage the jump sequence for Janek orbit.

Proceed to navpoint 2 to complete the exercise.

Well done!


Training Mission 6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Welcome to Training Mission 6 – Advanced Starship Combat!

For this exercise, you will be in command of the Asher-class destroyer
Mahan. Your objective for this mission is to seek out and destroy an
enemy starship of the Wolf class. There may be other traffic in the
sector, so make sure you confirm your target before engaging.

Let’s get started. Set your throttle ahead full and bring the helm
left seventy degrees to two-niner-zero. Look sharp, dead ahead, and you
may catch a glimpse of drive flares off in the distance. If there is
something out there, it must be beyond sensor range. The only way to know
for sure is to use a probe. To launch a probe, press F6, or click the
“P 04” indicator in the lower right corner of your sensor MFD. Your
sensor probes move quickly, but even so it will take a few moments for
one to reach that contact.

Contact! You have located the enemy Wolf-class destroyer Tarkis on
patrol in this sector. Range is over two hundred kilometers, heading
approximately zero-four-five degrees. At this distance, you will want
to use your ship’s nav system to plot an intercept course.

Press N to open the Navigation Screen. You should now be seeing a top-down
view of the Dante sector, with your own ship a small blue point near
the center of the display. Your contact, the Tarkis, is represented by
a small red point to the left.

To plot your course, first left-click your own ship, then right-click on
the map and select “Add Nav” from the popup menu. The mouse cursor
will change to a white cross, connected to your own ship by a blue line
representing your planned nav route. The Tarkis’s heading will take her
diagonally toward the upper-right of the map, so you want to place your
navpoint well out in front along her most probable course line. Place the
intercept nav point by left-clicking the map at the desired location. If
you need to adjust your course, you can always click and drag the existing
navpoints for your own ship, and any ship under your command. You can also
use the right-click menu to delete individual nav points, or clear the
entire route. Once the nav point is placed where you want it, click the
Commit button to engage the autonav system and return to the bridge view.

You are about to enter combat, so you’d better get yourself ready. Raise
your shields to maximum by pressing Shift+S. Press W to display the
weapons console, and make sure your PDBs are programmed for defensive
fire. For now, leave the other weapons on manual control. When you are
ready, click the AUTO indicator on your HUD to accelerate time and skip
ahead to the intercept point.

If you did everything correctly, when you regain control of your vessel,
you should be within targeting range of the enemy destroyer, so try to
lock her up now by pressing Y. If you cannot lock the target, go back
to the Navigation screen and try plotting a new intercept course that
will bring you in closer to the Tarkis projected position.

Good. Things are going to start happening quickly now, so stay on your
toes. Bring your helm about until the target is close to the center of
your HUD. Once you are in torpedo range of the target, you will see a
SHOOT cue in your HUD, just like when you are flying a fighter. You may
want to attempt a long shot from extreme range, but the Tarkis will most
likely defeat your torpedo shot with defensive fire from her PDBs. You
need to wear down her defenses before you go for the killing blow.

Using the small arrows in the lower right corner of the weapons console,
target your weapons on one of the Tarkis’ forward PDB systems. Close
range to within fifty kilometers and press and hold the Control key to
fire a long burst from your primary laser batteries. When the sub-target
system name in the weapons console turns red or starts blinking, you
have done enough damage to take that turret offline.

Use the weapons console to set your primary lasers for automatic firing
and cycle through the various PDB systems until you have most of them
eliminated. Your goal is to open a clear path for your torpedoes,
so concentrate your fire on the batteries that are aimed in your
direction. When you’re ready, cycle your system target to the Tarkis’
fusion reactor and set your torpedoes for automatic fire.

Excellent work! Stand down all weapons and return your shields to fifty
percent coverage.

All hands – abandon ship! Jettison the log buoy, and request immediate
combat area recovery!


Training Mission 7
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Welcome to Training Mission 7 – Carrier Operations!

For this mission, you will be aboard the Orion-class carrier Archer, and
in command of the carrier battle group patrolling the Alystra sector. Your
objective for this mission is to establish tactical superiority for the
entire sector.

Press F3 to switch to an external camera. You should begin the exercise
by establishing fighter coverage around your group. It is critical that
you keep a fresh supply of fighters in operation at all times, with more
ready to launch at a moment’s notice.

Press F to open the Flight Operations screen. This is your main tool
in managing the fighter patrol coverage as well as in ordering strikes,
escorts, and assaults against enemy targets. The top half of this screen
contains the squadron selector and the asset table, which shows you the
name and status of each fighter under your command. The bottom half
of the screen consists of the package controls that help you quickly
create and launch packages to meet specific objectives. When you open
the Flight Ops screen, it should be displaying status for the Avengers
intercept squadron. If it is not, choose the Avengers from the squadron
selector at the top of the screen.

Select a pair of fighters from the asset table by using Shift+Click. Click
the Patrol button to begin planning a patrol route for the package. Select
the ACM Medium Range loadout from the list at the bottom right of the
screen. Then click the Package button. The air boss will automatically
create a flight plan based on the mission profile you selected, and the
flight crew will prepare the birds for launch. After fifteen seconds,
the package will be loaded into an available launch bay and queued
for take-off.

The first patrol package will sweep the space ahead of your
carrier. Repeat this procedure three more times to establish full patrol
coverage around the battle group.

As they follow their patrol routes, your fighters will use their onboard
sensors to greatly extend your visibility around the sector. But even so,
they can’t cover everything. You have two more ships under your command,
and it’s time to put them to work.

Press N to display the Navigation Screen. On the right hand side, you
will see a list of all the starships active in the current sector. This
list can be useful when the map is zoomed out as it is now. Click the
Gerson in the list to select it. Now right click on the map and choose
“Add Nav” from the popup menu. The mouse cursor will change to a
white cross, connected to the Gerson by a blue line representing the
planned nav route. Left click somewhere in the upper right corner of
the map to place the nav point and send the Gerson on her way. Repeat
this process by selecting the Simmons in the list and placing another
nav point for her near the one you created for the Gerson.

Asher class destroyers are terrific anti-ship platforms, but their
limited point defense systems can leave them vulnerable to fighter
strikes. Since you are sending the destroyers away from the fighter
umbrella surrounding the carrier group, you should protect them by
assigning them a fighter escort.

Press F to return to the Flight Screen. Use the squadron selector at the
top to switch to the Stallions squadron of F-36 Stormhawk fighters. Select
two fighters from the asset table, and click the Escort button to begin
planning a route for them. Choose the Gerson from the objective list,
and select an ACM Medium Range loadout. When you are ready, click the
Package button to launch the fighter escort. The air boss will design
a flight plan that shadows the route you set for the two destroyers.

Press F3 to return to the external camera. The first patrol package has
detected a set of enemy contacts inbound. The patrol mission profile
allows them to engage at their discretion; they will attack the drones as
soon as they come within targeting range. Sometimes it is necessary to
order your fighters to attack a specific target. To do so, right click
one of your fighters and select “Engage” from the popup menu. Then
left click the desired target to issue the order to attack.

Excellent work! To complete the exercise, pull in the fighter
umbrella. Press F to return to the Flight Screen, and order all fighters
to return to base. Select all of the active fighters in the asset table
using Shift+Click. Then press the Recall button to order them to return
home.

Training Shuttle Proteus (formally)
  Archon, this is Proteus requesting vectors for approach and docking.

Archon Flight Controller (formally)
  Roger that Proteus, we have you on our sensors now. Checking your
  access codes.

  Affirmative Proteus, the pattern is clear. You are authorized for
  approach and docking. Come left fifteen degrees mark seven present
  course. Maintain three-fifty.

  *(continuing casually)*

  You guys are late. We were expecting you three hours ago. Everything ok?

Training Shuttle Proteus (casually)
  Yeah, sorry about that, Archon. We got a late start this morning; some
  of our 'cargo' was still asleep in the barracks - hard night I think.


Archon Flight Controller (casually)
  Kids!  Well, we’ll get ‘em straightened out eventually I
  suppose. Your group is the last to board. Once you’re tied down we
  can make the jump to Janus System to begin the training op.  And for
  making me wait you owe me a drink.


Training Shuttle Proteus (casually)

Campaign 2

NEWS 01 Campaign Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
SOLUS - The Provisional Security Directorate of the Independent System
of Solus formally requested military assistance from Terellian Alliance
Force:Command this morning. Special couriers ran the Trellis blockade to
deliver the message to the Force outpost in the nearby Janek system. "The
official government of this system has been cut off by the illegal
blockade of the Trellis Farcaster," said Adminstrator Lars of the
Directorate. "We have suffered a great deal of damage in the fighting,
and we need help to reestablish basic services here. "

Solus has been ripped nearly in two by the bloody civil war that
erupted between the Loyalist and Separatist factions of the system
government. Dantari Separatists under the leadership of Senator Masil
Gannet, after months of pressing for an official alliance with the
Hegemony Prefecture of Renser, have seized much of the Solus star fleet
and taken control of the outer worlds of Trellis and Jalah. The Loyalist
faction, although still technically in control of the official goverment,
has been trapped on the inner planets Solus and Meridian.

The Separatist blockade of the Trellis Farcaster has also taken a toll
on the many Alliance citizens in the Solus system. Several Terellian
companies maintain major offices on the capital world itself, and Tal
Vesta University runs a stellar observatory near the planet Meridian. An
estimated 375,000 Terellians are trapped by the blockade. So far they
have been unable to convince the Dantari Separatists to grant them safe
passage back to the main Alliance systems.


MAIL 01 (Jonas Devlin) Catching Up With You
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hey Mate!

I just heard about your promotion and wanted to say congratulations!
Sorry I didn't get to give you a proper send-off before you shipped out.

So the Force brass is starting to recognize your… “unique”
talents, eh?  You should have followed in my footsteps and joined the
Independent Trade fleet. Too bad you had to go and get all respectable,
you could have been a rich man by now. I'm not a rich man, but I'm sure
you would have been. Next time I see you I'll have to remember to salute.

Can't tell you too much on this end. The 'Maggie' just put in for a
forty-hour stopover in Loris on the way through to "parts unknown". Don't
ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no lies. But just between you
and me, watch your tail out there, OK?

Hey, are you going to the Academy Reunion this year?  We should be back
in the core systems by then, and I've been meaning to ask the skipper of
this here tub for some time off. If you complete your tour by then, I'll
catch you at the bar. You can buy me a drink in exchange for that salute.

\--Jonas

PS Have you heard from Sara lately?  I haven't been able to track her down
from way out here. If you talk to her, tell her "I am the Doorway" for me.


NEWS 02 Coup Failure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TELMERA CITY, SOLUS - An attempted palace coup by Dantari agents was
thwarted by alert members of the Provisional Security Directorate early
this morning. Separatist agents, working from a secret base near the
capital offices, succeeded in destroying the executive suite of the
presidential palace.

Security service members discovered the bomb only moments before it was
detonated and were able to escort President Marish and his party to an
undisclosed safe location. Senators Hamil and Covanon who were to attend
a working breakfast with the President were both killed in the blast, as
were two security service agents who died trying to protect them. Memorial
services for all four men are planned for later in the week.

Speaking on behalf of President Marish, executive spokesperson Cyn
Talban affirmed that the central government had not been struck
down by the terrorist-style attack. "We are still very much open for
business. President Marish is meeting with security advisors at this hour,
and he will be holding a press conference from the safehouse later this
morning to address your questions and concerns. "


NEWS 03 Blockade Broken
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TRELLIS - The Alliance Third Fleet has broken the blockade of the
Trellis-Solus Farcaster network, a Force:Command spokesperson has
announced. The minefields surrounding the Farcaster terminus have been
cleared, and several Separatist squadrons have been eliminated or greatly
reduced in strength.

Theater commander Admiral Evars has given official authorization for the
commencement of humanitarian aid traffic to the inner planets. Certified
non-governmental agencies delivering food, clothing, medicines, and
emergency equipment will receive protective escorts by warships from
the Third Fleet.

"Although the blockade has been broken, there are still several hostile
squadrons in operation near the outer worlds. We strongly recommend that
only emergency traffic be routed through the Trellis sector. Civilian
ships are advised to avoid the area until the threat can be assessed
and appropriate actions taken," Evars was quoted as saying.


MAIL 02 (Sara Hunter) New Digs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hello,

Well, we're finally just about moved in to the new Ele'aan Consular
Center. My new position as the Junior Consular Liason to the Ele'aan
Fusion rates a new office with a lovely view of the Endless Falls. At
twilight, when the mist shroud catches the light of the setting sun,
it's just breathtaking. Ever so much better than that sub-basement hovel
I was lurking in on Borova. Yay me!

Thanks for relaying that message from Jonas. "I am the Doorway"
Honestly, he's such a character. *[giggle]* I don't even know where he
could have heard that expression - it's part of an old Ele'aan greeting
and farewell ritual. The Ele'aans are an advanced race, but they can be
pretty inscrutable at times, even for me.

In fact, right now they are all agitated about the Zolon Empire for some
reason. They won't tell anybody what's going on, but I get little bits of
messages here and there, and they are definitely worried about something,
if you can believe that.

Say, if you talk to Jonas again, see if he knows anything about Zolon
activity. I know his trade route takes him through the northern Hegemony
systems. I don't know if he's ever been out as far as Nephrys in all
his wanderings. That's right on the border of Zolon space. Maybe he's
seen or heard something out there...

Congratulations on your promotion!  I knew you'd hit the big time
eventually. [grin]

Love from
Sara


BRIEFING 04 (Kash Anlon) Harmony Station at Risk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Field agents have intercepted communications believed to be for Dantari
Separatist strike teams in the Solus or Kalon sectors. COMINT has
completed first (partial) decoding of intercepted transmissions, and
believes there is a credible threat to High Value Assets (HVAs) in Solus
and Kalon sectors. Specific times, targets, and methods remain unknown.

Force:Intel recommends additional Force:Space patrols be assigned
to the Kalon sector pending further analysis of intercepted
transmissions. Harmony Station in Kalon orbit would make an extremely
choice target for a Separatist strike.


BRIEFING 05 (Kash Anlon) Foothill Ridge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Intel field agents have uncovered a Separatist military base
in the city of Foothill Ridge near Telmera on Solus. The encampment
consists of an operational airbase, reactor complex, weapons bunkers,
and an unknown complement of transorbital fighters and personnel. The
Foothill Ridge Base is protected by a series of AAA and SAM batteries
in the hills surrounding the city.

Force:Intel recommends Force:Space deploy a package of air strikes
to reduce the fixed weapon emplacements and the airbase. The reactor
complex does not appear to be needed for civilian power in the Foothill
Ridge area. However, the reactor poses an unknown danger to the area of
radiation and/or toxic chemical contamination if it is destroyed using
air-to-ground weapons.  So you will need to be careful when you prosecute
your ground strikes.


BRIEFING 06 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Renser Buildup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Space long range sensor patrols report probable fleet buildup in
the Hegemony system of Renser. Ship movement in the system has increased
by 137% in the past twenty hours.

Mass density analysis indicates several ships have left berths in the
Lornas asteroid belt. Lornas Sector contains the major outer reserve naval
yards for the Renser system. Common displacement includes Broadsword Class
Destroyer Squadrons and Dragon Class Carrier Groups. Force:Intel COMINT
reports increased signal activity in the Khaital Sector staging area. The
Renser central capital has been placed on heightened security awareness.

Tactical Planning Analysis suggests 50% probability of Renser mobilization
to Solus system within the next twenty hours. Probability of mobilization
within the next fifty hours is estimated to be greater than 80%.


NEWS 07 Research Lab
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MERIDIAN - The Tal Vesta University Stellar Observatory in Meridian orbit
has been cut off by Separatist patrols and is facing severe shortages
of food and consumable supplies. University staff indicate that the
fusion plant on the observatory is still operational, and that basic
life support functions - water, air, and power - are not an immediate
concern. "Mainly, the students are just hungry. And frustrated," said
Research Coordinator Alen Tolap.

Student researchers living at the observatory are protesting the ongoing
civil war. Native Solusans, ethnic Dantari, and even many Terellian
Alliance students have issued a joint statement condemning the conflict
and demanding the resumption of peaceful negotiations. Thus far, neither
party in the conflict has commented on the student protests.

Alliance Theater Command has promised to make humanitarian aid to the
Meridian sector a top priority. "We'll find a way to feed these kids,"
Fleet Admiral Evars was quoted as saying. "There's nothing more ornery
than a bunch of hungry college students. "


NEWS 08 Renser Accusation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
CITY OF ULNAR, RENSER - The Renser Secretary of Intersystem Affairs issued
a statement this evening accusing the Terellian Alliance of committing
illegal acts of agression in the Solus Conflict.

"External involvement in this civil conflict is a clear violation of the
Korian Treaty. Alliance actions are a threat to Solusan sovereignty, and
constitute a clear and present danger to the security of the Prefecture
of Renser. Strong measures may be taken to restore normal discourse in
Solus. "

Policy analysts believe that this statement amounts to diplomatic code
words for the commencement of Renser military action in the Solusan
conflict. The statement does not set a timeline for events, but the
general feeling is that something is going to happen sooner rather
than later.


NEWS 09 Senate Resolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ALLIANCE CAPITAL, JARNELL - Alliance government officials wasted no
time in responding to the accusations of illegality made yesterday
by the Renser Secretary of Intersystem Affairs. The Combined Senate
passed resolution SR498 censuring the Prefecture of Renser and warning
of possible reprisals should Hegemony forces become involved in the
Solusan Conflict.

"The Alliance has undertaken Operation Highland for the specific
purposes of safeguarding our citizens in the Solus system and providing
humanitarian aid to those civilians who have been hardest hit by the
blockade of the inner worlds. These actions have been carried out in
strict accord with Korian Treaty provisions, and we resent the implication
that the Alliance has Imperial designs on our neighbors. "

Several anonymous sources have hinted that there may be more to this
conflict than is immediately apparent. Rumors of an Hegemony fleet buildup
in Renser have leaked from Force:Command Headquarters. Others have
expressed suspicions regarding the breakdown of peaceful negotiations
between the Loyalist and Separatist factions that directly led to the
current hostilities.

Military analysts are predicting that although widening of the Solusan
Conflict to include Renser was unexpected and is undesirable, it may
soon become unavoidable. Alliance forces appear to have gained the upper
hand in some of the fiercest fighting of the war to date. A Force:Space
garrison, once established in the Solus system, would be within easy
striking distance of Renser. That is a situation that no Hegemony border
world would be willing to tolerate.


BRIEFING 10 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Renser Arrival
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Task Force 4.3 from the Hegemony Fourth Fleet "Manticore" has successfully
translated in system and is currently staging through Jalah Sector. The
task force appears to have bypassed the Trellis Sector entirely, somehow
translating directly into Jalah orbit. This may have been achieved
by first staging beyond the outer Oort cloud before attempting the
final jump.

Hegemony Task Force 4. 3 is composed of one Dragon-class CVBG, and two
Broadsword class DESRONs. The Dragon class carrier groups generally field
a full complement of intercept, fighter, and attack squadrons, and we
believe that this is no exception. On paper, this makes the Hegemony Task
Force heavier than the Alliance forces assigned to the Solus system. We
have requested a Spectre class DESRON from Fleet to help shore us up,
but we are unsure as to how long they will take to arrive.

On the plus side, we have the advantage of maneuverability for the
moment. Now that they are here, they will need some time to get organized
and integrated with the Dantari fleet framework. If they did in fact
take two jumps to translate to Jalah, they will need to UNREP before
they are ready to fight. Either way, we estimate they will be tied up
near Fort Talas in Jalah Sector for at least fifteen to twenty more hours.


BRIEFING 11 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Dantari Pullback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All mobile Separatist forces have withdrawn from the inner planets
to Jalah Sector. We believe they plan to regroup and integrate with
Hegemony TF4.3 before resuming the offensive in the Solus and Kalon
Sectors. Alliance forces have been doing an excellent job of reducing
Separatist fleet strength, and Loyalist security forces believe that
they can handle the job of cleaning up the remaining ground based
Separatist units.

However, the combined weight of Hegemony and Separatist forces will
very likely overmatch our capabilities. We have received word that
Spectre-class DESRON 43 "Shadow" has been assigned to the Solusan
conflict, but they will not arrive for at least another fifteen hours.

In the meantime, our plan is to strike the Separatist forces at Jalah
before they can regroup. If we can keep them off balance in a defensive
posture there, we believe they will be prevented from mounting an
effective attack on Solus.

Simulations suggest that the combined force will try to regroup near
Fort Talas Station, using its air cover and defensive fire to protect the
fleet. Remember that our primary objective is to cripple the Separatist
fleet, not the Hegemony Task Force, and definitely not the station. Fort
Talas belongs to the Solusan government, and is their primary defensive
outpost in the outer worlds. The station will be vital to their defensive
plans after this conflict is over, so we must not cause any more damage
to it than absolutely necessary.


NEWS 12 Cease Fire
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TELMERA CITY, SOLUS - Guns are falling silent throughout the Solus System
in accordance with a cease-fire agreement between the Solusan government
and the Separatist faction that have been locked in a violent civil
war for control of the region. ISS President Marish and newly-appointed
leader of the Separatist movement Ayn Toran signed the agreement in the
recently repaired presidential palace as Terellian Alliance Fleet Admiral
A. Evars looked on. Notably absent from the signing ceremony was former
Separatist leader Masil Gannet, who is believed to have fled the system
to return to his native Adantar in the Korius System.

The cease-fire agreement has sparked hopes for a lasting peace in this
war-torn region that has suffered unprecedented levels of bloodshed
in a very short period of time. The pact is the first step to renewed
peace talks to address the fair settlement of ethnic Dantari throughout
the system.

The deal calls for an open-ended cease-fire between both parties, with
independent observers from the nearby system of Silessia to monitor
the situation until more permanent agreements can be implemented. The
details of the cease-fire agreement have not yet been made public.

Pursuant to the cease-fire arrangement, Hegemony Fleet Task Force
4.3 is standing down and will abandon the system within hours. The
Terellian Alliance Task Force that has been assisting the official
Solusan Government is also making plans to leave the region.


NEWS 13 Renser Invasion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The PRESIDENT of the TERELLIAN ALLIANCE:

My fellow citizens, at this hour, Force:Space units are in the early
stages of military operations to disarm the Hegemony Prefecture of Renser
and eliminate a grave threat to the peace and stability of the Terellian
Alliance and the Independent Systems of the blue drift.

On my orders, under the authority granted to this office by Combined
Senate Resolution SR498, Alliance forces have begun striking specific
military targets in the Renser System to undermine that government's
ability to wage agressive war on her neighbors. The victory of the
Solusan people in Operation Highland can not be complete until the hard
won peace has been made secure.

Now, that peace is gravely threatened by the armed might of the
Hegemony. In fact, we have evidence that the entire Solusan affair was
instigated by agents of Renser Prefecture, including former Separatist
Leader Masil Gannet.

To all the men and women of the various branches of Force now serving
in the Renser Theater of Operations, the peace of a troubled region,
and the hope for prosperity of all its free people now depend on you,
on your determination, and on your abilities. We trust in your abilities
and your resolve, and we know that our trust is well placed.

Now that this stage of the conflict has come, the only way to limit its
duration is to apply decisive force. And I assure you, this will not be
a campaign of half measures. We will accept no outcome save victory.

Thank you, and good evening.


MAIL 03 (Sara Hunter) Why Renser?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Why are we attacking Renser now?  Why Renser, and why now?

The Ele'aan Ambassador, Councilor Auris was most... well, I don't think
"upset" is the right word. But he seemed very disconcerted about the
potential consequences of this invasion during the Council meeting this
morning. I think the Ele'aan delegation tried to talk President Valmar
out of this action - I think they wanted him to leave well enough alone
and stay out of Hegemony internal affairs.

I hope you're all right out there. I just get worried when the Alliance
government doesn't... Just tell me you'll be safe out there, OK?

Love from
Sara


END 1 – VICTORY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Alliance forces have completed operations in the Solus-Renser
Theater. Hegemony resistance has been broken and the Prefect of Renser is
meeting with the Alliance Provisional Consulate at this hour to establish
terms for a cease-fire and eventual non-agression pact.

All Force:Space units in Third Fleet will be withdrawing from Renser space
to predetermined guard points in the surrounding systems. Force:Command
expects to be able to rotate your unit back to home space within a few
weeks for replenishment and shore leave.

Well done, Commander!


END 2 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Highland has failed to secure the peace. Alliance losses have
been severe. The President, with the approval of the Combined Senate, has
ordered an immediate withdrawal of all Force units from the Solus-Renser
Theater. Civilian casualties are estimated at more than 28,000 dead and
52,000 injured or missing.

At least one additional fleet is being mobilized from the Hegemony system
of Korius. Force:Command expects that they will translate in system
within forty hours. At that time, the Independent System of Solus will
be brought under the direct control of the Marakan Hegemony.


END 3 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Highland has failed in its mission to secure the peace. Alliance
losses in the Renser system have been severe, including the loss of the
Fleet Carrier Battle Group Archon. The President, with the approval
of the Combined Senate, has ordered the immediate withdrawal of all
remaining Force:Space units from the Prefecture of Renser.

At least one additional Hegemony fleet is being mobilized from the
Korius System. We can only hope that this failure does not result in
the unilateral escalation on the part of Hegemony forces...


Campaign 3
----------

NEWS 01 Campaign Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
JARNELL - Just four local months after the success of Operation
Highland, the Terellian Alliance has once more been plunged into violent
conflict. For the first time in its five hundred year history, enemy
forces have invaded core Alliance systems and attacked civilian ships
and property.

"Using the Force involvement in the Solusan-Renser Conflict as a pretext,
two key systems within the Marakan Hegemony have formally declared war
on the people of the Terellian Alliance," Force:Space Fleet Commander
A. Evars was quoted as saying.

The attack has employed two bold thrusts. The Hegemony Sixth Fleet out
of Kolchev System has taken the Independent Civil Protectorate of Haiche
and proceeded to assault targets at the Force proving grounds in Janus
System. Simultaneously, the Hegemony Seventh Fleet has left its home
port in Loris and bypassed the neutral Silessian Confederacy to begin
a rapid invasion of the Borovan Republic (see diagram at right).

Alliance forces are said to be scrambling to defend and hold these two
key systems before the invasions can be completed. Force:Command joint
chiefs expressed cautious optimism that early and decisive containment
could prevent this conflict from developing into a full scale war.


NEWS 02 President Speech
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The PRESIDENT of the TERELLIAN ALLIANCE :

My fellow citizens, together we now face an unprecedented crisis in
the long history of our proud nation. The Terellian Alliance is under
attack by an implacable enemy. Warships from systems under the control
of the Marakan Hegemony are even now invading core Alliance systems,
including Janus and the Borovan Republic.

To meet this threat before it can engulf any more of our sovereign
territory or endanger any more civilian lives, I have authorized and
commanded Force combined military to begin Operation Shining Fortress
in defense of our home worlds. The cost of this defense will be great,
but the cost of surrender would be even greater.

As another great leader once told his people, 'I have nothing to offer
you but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. ' The time of this war will not
be short, but together we will stand victorious, made fast to the resolve
that freedom, honor, and justice shall not perish from our worlds.

I urge each of you to remain calm through this long, dark night. Brace
yourselves to your individual duties, and together we shall greet a new
dawn of peace.

Thank you, and may fortune favor our brave men and women at arms.


MAIL 01 (Jonas Devlin) Almost Home
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hi Mate,

I don't know if you made the Academy Reunion or not, sorry I missed
catching you there. This has been a bloody awful year. The trade scouting
mission did not go as well as I had hoped.

We were delayed in Nephrys System for two months when the Loris Trade
Executive cancelled our return visas. Nephrys is really out on the rim,
I thought we'd never get back. As it was, it took weeks to find the
right sort of contact to forge a new registration for the Maggie and
get us cleared through Korius to try the southern route back home. We
had to sneak the long way around - four hops - to avoid the military
build-up in Kolchev.

We jumped out of Haiche only a couple of days ahead of the invasion
force. (In case you haven't heard yet, you're under attack mate. )
Right lovely dump you got here in Janus. Not a decent bar in sight,
and I could really use a drink or ten. We're pretty banged up, but I
think we can make Jarnell and maybe sit down at Thralis for repairs.

Good luck, mate. It's getting nasty out there.

\--Jonas


NEWS 03 Titan Destroyed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In a devastating surprise attack, Hegemony destroyers and cruisers
assaulted the Titan 7th Carrier Battle Group while in Borova orbit. The
fleet carrier AFS Titan is believed lost with all hands, although
some of the embarked 21st Tactical Fighter Wing may have been able to
escape. Damage from the fighting was extensive, and several other ships
in the Titan carrier group may have been damaged or destroyed.

The sudden reversal has staggered the Seventh Fleet. All surviving
units are rapidly withdrawing before Hegemony forces can strike again. A
temporary strategic loss of the Borovan system seems likely at this point.

Force:Space 12th Carrier Battle Group led by AFS Chronos is being
readied in Jarnell fleet yards to take over for the Titan. However,
this carrier group is generally reserved for systemic defense. The 29th
Tactical Fighter Wing attached to the carrier contains only half the
number of fighters of the Wing it will be asked to replace.


BRIEFING 04 (Kash Anlon) Fort Talden
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Intel field agents in the Borovan Capital report extensive fighting
by advance units of the Hegemony invasion force. The Fort Talden Advanced
Projects Laboratory has been attacked and is now in the hands of Hegemony
AAF. Agents are attempting to infiltrate the laboratory and destroy
sensitive materials before they can be captured or documented.

Force:Intel recommends Force:Space accelerate deployment of transorbital
platforms in Borova Sector. A package of air strikes could reduce the
risk of intel compromise, if assets can be deployed within ten hours.


MAIL 02 (Sara Hunter) Back to Borova
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hello,

I still can't quite bring myself to believe that we are at war with the
Hegemony. The Consulate is leaving on a "Fact Finding" mission to Borova,
and I'll be going along to support the diplomatic corps. We should be in
system within thirty hours or less, although it doesn't really feel like
"going home. "

Isn't your unit patrolling the outer sectors? I think this may be
the first time we've been in the same system at the same time since
university. Strange that it should be under such circumstances.

The Ele'aan Ambassador still thinks the Zolon Empire is behind the Marakan
invasion. I must say, I don't see how that is even possible. Zolons can
barely communicate with humans. How would they orchestrate the Hegemony
into a major interstellar war? With sign language?

Anyway, I don't know if I'll get any free time while we are in-system. If
I do, I'll try to make it over to Vestapol and see your parents. I'd
love to see the museums on the Grand Concourse (come to think of it,
I haven't been shopping in Vestapol in ages). But that would be too much
to hope for, I suppose.

Love from
Sara


NEWS 05 Grand Concourse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
VESTAPOL, BOROVA - The Borovan planetary capital was a scene of
fierce fighting in last night's raids by Hegemony advanced ground
forces. Military, logistic, and even civilian targets on the Grand
Concourse suffered extensive damage.

Tourist Sara Hunter was an eyewitness to the action: "It was a long
night. I'm still a bit shaken. I had just left the Museum of Precolonial
Antiquities when Hegemony forces started hitting it with rocket
fire. Fortunately, I was able to take shelter in a small shop across
from the museum district. About twenty minutes later, there was a huge
explosion and the MPCA was nothing but ashes. " Military analysts believe
that low-yield shaped plasma charges were used on some of the targets.

The pattern to the attacks is unclear, and may be the result of spotty
intelligence gathering by Hegemony forces. "I have no idea why they hit
the museum district so hard. I'm just glad I got out before they did,"
said Hunter.


NEWS 06 Ele’aan Diplomats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
BOROVA - The Ambassador for the Ele'aan Fusion announced the recall
of diplomatic missions to the Marakan Hegemony and the Zolon Empire
today. "Our fact-finding mission to Borova is complete and our findings
are conclusive. We return to Jarnell to present the detailed information
directly to the Terellian President and his advisors. The Zolon Empire
and the states of the Marakan Hegemony act together in this invasion,
in direct violation of the Korian Treaty, Section Four, Paragraph 7a. We
recall all of our diplomatic missions to those systems. "

Force military analysts insist that they can find no evidence of
Zolon involvement in the recent invasion, which seems to be a purely
human affair. "The Zolon Empire has never shown much interest in the
core Alliance systems, since they contain no worlds suitable for Zolon
life. Thus far, we haven't detected any prohibited weapons technology in
use by the Hegemony invasion force. Our main goal is to regain control
of the system and bring Operation Shining Fortress to a successful
conclusion. Accusing the Zolon Empire of involvement is not consistent
with that goal. "

The Zolons are a hive-like hereditary empire on the northern border
of Hegemony space. Zolon drones are outwardly similar to Earth crabs,
although they evolved in a desert climate without liquid water. They are
less than one meter in height but their six legs can reach a span of
over two meters. The Zolon species is very intelligent, but also very
different from humans. They use neither written nor spoken languages,
instead communicating through chemical messengers, gestures, and a form
of electromagnetic radiation that may serve them as telepathy. These
differences make it very difficult for Zolons and humans to communicate
effectively.


MAIL 03 (Jonas Devlin) Down for Repairs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hey Mate,

Well, Maggie is in the shop. We made it into Thralis just in time to
lose the quantum drive. We're sitting in the Organon Motives repair yard
waiting on parts for a drive overhaul while I try to call in every favor
I have left in the system. I'm just about ready to steal the whole drive
system from the next Force Cruiser that passes by just so that we can
get back underway.

At least I've had a chance to get caught up on the local nets. This war
of yours is big news out here mate, and Thralis isn't exactly on the
front lines. The Thracian Titans even canceled their season ending match
against Sparta in honor of the lost crew of the CV-72. Really though,
I think Thrace just needed an excuse to avoid the match. Hollis is the
worst manager they've had in a decade. Anyway, I was glad to see your
name wasn't on the missing in action list.

Hey, did you see the news interview with Sara the first night of the
fighting in Vestapol?  Strange coincidence that she would happen to be
on the ground just when a squad of Hegemony goons shows up to knock over
the museum. Glad she's all right. Good thing that guardian angel of hers
was working over time.

Stay sharp out there. I don't think anyone is looking out for your
welfare except you!

\--Jonas


BRIEFING 07 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Athenar
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Part of the Hegemony Seventh Fleet has broken off from the main formation
in Janus. Hegemony 17th Battle Group led by the heavy cruiser "Intruder"
has successfully breached the Athenar system.

This invasion places our forces in a difficult position. Until now,
we have had the advantage of position in the Janus system. The Hegemony
invasion fleet has been operating with a stretched supply line, while we
have had greater reserves of fuel and ordnance and the backing of ground
bases to exploit them. The Hegemony invasion of Athenar will now force
us to defend two systems with our smaller fleet. Although this invasion
divides the Hegemony forces, it is a net tactical advantage for them.

At this point in the campaign, we cannot tolerate additional civilian
casualties in the core systems. Force:Command has therefore decided to
commit sufficient force to eliminate the Hegemony battle group in Athenar
before it can be reinforced by additional supporting units. Fifth Fleet
battle group "Furious" and destroyer squadron "Enigma" will proceed to
Athenar immediately and engage all Hegemony units therein.

Good luck and good hunting.


NEWS 08 Liberation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The PRESIDENT of the TERELLIAN ALLIANCE :

Today is Liberation Day. The tide has turned in the battle to secure our
homelands and protect our way of life. The men and women of the various
branches of Force have fought and bled, and their toil and suffering has
been rewarded with a string of decisive military victories in the core
systems. At this hour, I am pleased to announce that Hegemony forces are
rapidly withdrawing from our borders to seek safety in the independent
systems of Silessia and Haiche to the west.

Force:Command has already issued clearance for reconstruction efforts to
get underway. Later this morning I will be meeting with key members of
the Combined Senate to prepare contingent appropriations and authorize
emergency funding for aid to the affected systems of Janus, Borova,
and Athenar. I know how hard it has been for those of you caught on the
ground in this conflict, and I know how many of your loved ones have been
lost in the ground attacks and in the cold vacuum of space. Although
this administration can never fully heal the losses you have suffered,
take comfort in knowing that help is on the way for you to recover,
rebuild, and ultimately move on.

However, while reconstruction begins at home, the job of our forces
in the field is not yet fully complete. The peace can not stand while
Hegemony forces lie in wait on the edge of our space. And so I must order
a continuation of Operation Shining Fortress to extend the peace from
our own borders to those of our independent neighbors. We must liberate
Haiche and Silessia, just as our own systems have been liberated. Hegemony
forces must return to their antebellum status in Loris and Kolchev.

Only then shall we find respite from sorrow, and rediscover the joy
of peace.


BRIEFING 09 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Silessian Confederacy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Space Fourth Fleet has been assigned to engage Hegemony forces
operating in the independent system of Silessia. Our main goals are to
force the Hegemony to withdraw, while minimizing civilian casualties
and property damage.

The Silessian Confederacy has been an outspokenly neutral power in this
region for centuries. Official government policy here is to avoid taking
sides in any conflict, to the extent that Silessia maintains no armed
forces beyond those needed for commercial traffic enforcement. Neutrality
has worked out very well here, and the banking and communications sectors
have become quite wealthy.

In fact, they have become so wealthy that the Silessian government is
planning a colonial expedition to an undeveloped system far to the north
of the Blue Drift region. They have a colony ship in orbit around the
main planet preparing to depart. We believe the ship is complete and is
in the process of boarding the passengers and cargo for the expedition.

Fourth Fleet will have two main defensive priorities during the next
hundred hours - defending the colony ship and protecting the swarm of
communications satellites that keep the banks and telcos in operation.

More detailed analyses will be made available as the situation develops.


BRIEFING 10 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Haiche Protectorate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Space Fifth Fleet has been assigned to engage Hegemony forces
operating in the Haiche Protectorate. Our main goals are to force the
Hegemony to withdraw, while minimizing civilian casualties and property
damage.

Haiche is a protected independent outpost with a small indigenous
population. The system contains two medium size gas giant planets, and one
very dry and very dusty world of approximately terrestrial conditions. The
desert planet, which is also named Haiche, is sparsely populated. The
inhabitants are mainly mineral researchers, xenoarchaeologists, and
enough trades to support and feed the general population.

The Haiche Protectorate has never had the funds to adequately police
the outer gas giants. They have become havens for traders and pirates
due to their large collection of small moons. We may expect to encounter
some surprises in the Cygnus and Tal Amin sectors.


BRIEFING 11 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Tantalus
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Haiche has been a protected independent outpost for the past sixty years,
since the Korian treaty was signed. Per the treaty, neither Hegemony
nor Alliance citizens may establish residence in the system, and even
travel through the system has been strictly controlled.  The main planet,
Haiche, is the reason for the treaty. In the past, many nations have
made claims on the wealth of heavy metals buried deep beneath the surface.

Force:Intel field operatives were able to pass through the Haiche
system recently. Their report indicates that the Hegemony Seventh Fleet
had invaded in force and reopened an illegal mining operation in the
Tantalus sector. The heavy metals extracted by such mines are usually
toxic to terrestrial life. Haiche has deep seams of tantalum, iridium,
and even some gold, all of which are used in modern industry.

Force:Command will be working closely with the Corps of Engineers other
materials experts to assess any risks to the local population that may
arise either from the Hegemony operation working the mine or Alliance
forces attacking it.


NEWS 12 Colony Ship
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
'FAR HORIZON' SILESSIA ORBIT - Even shrouded as she is by the pre-launch
support framework, the Far Horizon is an awesome sight. The colony ship
is kilometers long - larger than some groundside cities - a series of
silver-white cylinders sparkling from within through hundreds of port
windows. The central habitation pillar is surrounded by a ring of six
fusion drive units that will one day propel this ship into the great
unknown, north of the Blue Drift.

When fully loaded, the Far Horizon will become home to fifty thousand
colonists and flight crewmembers. To accompany the human colonists
are more than ten million terrestrial animals stored as cryogenically
frozen embryos, each smaller than the period at the end of this
sentence. However, while the embryos are all on board in special
refrigeration modules, most of the human colonists remain on the planet
below.

"When we are operating at full capacity, we can bring two thousand
people aboard the ship every day," said the expedition leader, Captain
Anders. "Two thousand people is pretty much the limit of both our heavy
lift capacity, and the airlock and berthing systems. Unfortunately,
since the Hegemony lock-down we haven't been able to bring aboard two
people, much less two thousand. "

The Marakan Hegemony fleet occupying the Silessian system has imposed a
moratorium on all in-system travel by civilian personnel, ostensibly to
prevent terrorists and saboteurs from striking the colony ship. However,
until the embargo is lifted, no progress can be made in bringing aboard
the more than forty thousand colonists living in the quarantine center
on Silessia. "For now, we can only watch and wait. And hope that this
delay doesn't cause us to miss our launch window," said Captain Anders.


BRIEFING 13 (Vice Admiral Caldott) The Brotherhood of Iron
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Advance trading scouts have reported that pirates from the so-called
Brotherhood of Iron criminal organization are taking advantage of the
Hegemony invasion to prey on civillian transports in the Silessian
system. Reports indicate the presence of small and medium starships
as well as several fighter class vessels. One of the scouts was able
to deliver a sensor snapshot of the "Marauder" class starship shown at
the right.

The Brotherhood of Iron has been spreading through the unpoliced
sectors of the Marakan Hegemony for several decades. In recent years
they have grown more bold and started to establish a presence in the
outback. Most of these characters are wanted by police organizations in
both the Alliance and the Hegemony. Under normal circumstances, we would
be expected to follow security protocols and allow civillian authorities
to apprehend them.

However, these are no longer normal circumstances. The President's mandate
for Operation Shining Fortress has effectively asked us to assert martial
law in the Silessian system. If you have a safe opportunity to engage
Brotherhood forces without undue danger to civillian lives or property
then you have permission to take them out.

Good hunting.


END 1 – VICTORY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Alliance forces have completed operations in the independent systems of
Silessia and Haiche. The Hegemony invasion has been forced to withdraw
completely from Alliance controlled space, and is now preparing to
abandon their positions in the neutral territories as well. Given the
circumstances, both Force and civillian casualties have been remarkably
light.

The President of the Terellian Alliance will be addressing all members
of Force in the field within a few hours. In the meantime, hold your
positions and observe the temporary cease fire.

Well done, Commander!


END 2 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With a final concerted effort, Hegemony forces have overrun the
Force:Space defenses and captured key positions in Borova, Janus, and
Athenar. The Alliance has sustained devastating losses in these attacks
and has lost the ability to defend key systems from the Hegemony invasion.

The Alliance President, with the approval of the remaining Combined
Senators, has called for an immediate cease-fire to discuss terms for
the Alliance surrender to Hegemony forces.

The loss of these two key systems to the Hegemony will certainly result
in the dissolution of the Terellian Alliance.


END 3 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Although Alliance forces have successfully repelled the Hegemony invasion
of Borova and Janus, the mission to protect the independent systems of
Silessia and Haiche has failed. Force:Space losses in the field have
been far too great to continue prosecuting the campaign. And while the
reconstruction is underway, and with our western borders so exposed,
we cannot commit any additional fleets to support the liberation of our
independent neighbors.

Even though our own homes are safe for now, this operation cannot be
considered a success. We will almost certainly be facing a new Hegemony
offensive before too much longer…


Campaign 4
----------

NEWS 01 Campaign Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
JARNELL - The ink is barely dry on the cease-fire order that brought a
halt to Operation Shining Fortress but Alliance Force starships are once
again being sent into harm's way. The Sixth Fleet left Force Yards in
Jarnell several days ago, and after proceeding along the southern route
through recently-liberated Haiche, has begun operations in the Hegemony
border system of Ostara.

Force officials have so far downplayed the importance of this fleet
engagement. "Shortly before the war began, long range scouts detected a
secret Hegemony base in the Ostara system, near the planet Aram. In the
interest of establishing a safe buffer zone for the Haiche Protectorate,
we are taking this opportunity to encourage those forces to return to
the core Hegemony worlds," Force:Space Fleet Commander A. Evars was
quoted as saying.

Independent military analysts at the prestigious Wiggen Institute
think-tank have observed that another Alliance fleet is also being
prepared in the Paragon system. "Having two additional expeditionary
fleets in operation right now strongly suggests that Force is preparing
for a wider conflict in the near future," said Chu Vo of the institute.

Force:Command joint chiefs declined to comment on speculations that a
major offensive was being planned against the middle Hegemony systems. "I
have no information on that subject that I can share with you at the
present time," said Evars.


NEWS 02 Borovan Archaelith
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
VESTAPOL, BOROVA - Museum of Precolonial Antiquities

Sifting through the debris and damage left behind by the Hegemony attack
has been an arduous process for museum curator Josef Severn. Large
portions of the museum complex were leveled by plasma weapons used
during the fighting, and advanced scientific intrustments have been
needed to sort out fragments of ancient artifacts from the scattered
pieces of the walls and display cases that once housed them. After weeks
of painstaking work, most of the items in the museum's collection of
antiquities have been identified. However, the Borovan Archaelith remains
among the missing.

The Museum of Precolonial Antiquities was established sixty years ago
by the Borovan Government to preserve and research xeno-archaelogical
discoveries on the Baradan Peninsula. The Museum specializes in the
ancient artifacts of the unknown "Precursor" civilization that inhabited
the Blue Drift Region some eight million years ago. Little is known about
the Precursor species, and only a few of their technological works have
survived the eight thousand millenia since their demise.

The Borovan Archaelith is the oldest and most complete artifact in the
museum collection. The object is a perfect black crystal, almost half a
meter in length. To the naked eye, the Archaelith appears to be a smooth
hexagonal prism. However, deep sonic imaging has revealed a surprisingly
complex inner structure of facets and fissures of unknown purpose.

When the museum clean-up process began to recover fragments of the other
Precursor artifacts, there was initial hope that the Archaelith might
be recovered intact. The ancient crystal had been removed from public
display and taken to a scanning laboratory in a separate part of the
museum only hours before the attack began. The scanning facility was
heavily sheltered to prevent ambient radiation from interfering with
the sensitive tests, and this served to protect the laboratory from the
worst damage of the heavy plasma weapons.

However, it now appears that some Hegemony ground forces may have
entered the laboratory wing of the museum during the battle. Much of
the equipment in the area was destroyed by small arms fire, and several
rooms were forcibly entered. The Hegemony has officially denied removing
any of the ancient artifacts from the museum or laboratories. But today,
weeks after the fighting has ended, the location of the Borovan Archaelith
remains a mystery.


BRIEFING 03 (Kash Anlon) Technite Discovered
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Intel field agents involved in clean-up and security operations
at Tantalus Mining Station on Haiche have reported detecting traces
of Technite in unprocessed ores stockpiled at the refinery. Technite
does not occur naturally on Haiche, or any other known planet in the
periphery. Neither the Alliance nor the Hegemony has found a way to
synthesize it. The only known sources of the material are archaic;
trace deposits were found on Borova on the Baradan Peninsula near the
Precursor discoveries.

Further analysis of the ore and the recovered mining equipment from
Tantalus Station suggests that the site contained only small amounts
of rare earth metals of any value. It seems unlikely that the Hegemony
would risk an illegal mining operation to recover such small amounts
of tantalum and iridium. It appears that Tantalus Mining Station was
specifically tasked with recovering technite from Haiche. It is presently
impossible to determine how much technite was extracted, refined, and
shipped offworld prior to Force capture of the planet.

Force:Intel does not have an analysis of possible Hegemony motives at
this time. Technite is considered a laboratory curiousity and has no
known practical applications. Borovan technite deposits were of such
small quantities that our best materials science experts have not yet
fully classified all of its physical properties.


BRIEFING 04 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Zolon Ambassador
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Zolon Ambassador to Tarsus has offered to broker peace negotiations
between the Terellian Alliance and the Marakan Hegemony. The Zolons have
invited representatives from both sides to meet aboard their Consular
Starship in Tarsus orbit to discuss plans to de-escalate the conflict
in which we are now engaged.

Militarily, this seems an unlikely plan. It is doubtful that the Hegemony
is ready to make serious concessions at this time as they probably see the
outcome of the war to be too hard to predict. They are still very much in
this fight, and they have not yet lost any real territory to our advance.

Politically however, this is not an opportunity that we can simply
ignore. A diplomatic team has been dispatched from Haiche to rendezvous
with Sixth Fleet. The fleet will then translate to the Tarsus system by
02/12:00:00 to rendezvous with the Zolon Consular Starship.

Realistically, we knew we would have to invade Tarsus in force sooner
or later. This development simply advances the timetable and gives us
an opportunity to enter the system relatively unopposed.

Note that we are now operating under a flag of truce until the
negotiations have concluded. Rules of Engagement: Do not fire unless you
are fired upon. Stay alert. There will be plenty of Hegemony warships
in the area. Anything could happen if we are not careful.


NEWS 05 Operation Firestorm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The PRESIDENT of the TERELLIAN ALLIANCE :

My fellow citizens, once again the dark shadow of a violent foe has
darkened our hope for lasting interstellar peace. Even as an Alliance
diplomatic team was at work in the Tarsus system negotiating a peace
treaty to end the ongoing conflict with the Hegemony, a surprise enemy
attack has devestated the peace process and thrown us all even further
into chaos and war. Zolon warships acting in concert with Hegemony agents
have attacked the peace conference, killing our negotiating team even at
the expense of destroying every member of the Zolon Consulate in Tarsus.

Even more disturbing, we have confirmed reports from Force:Intelligence,
combined with information provided by the Ele'aan Ambassador that lead
us to only one conclusion. The recent Hegemony attacks on Alliance
territory were carried out with the specific intention of recovering
ancient artifacts and rare materials for use in developing a devestating
new type of weapon. The Ele'aan Ambassador has informed us that the
Hegemony military are working with scientists of the Zolon Empire to use
the Borovan Archaelith to process Technite to create a "Quantum Disruptor"
that will destroy computer systems and render even our strongest warships
incapable of faster-than-light travel.

Within the past hour, this office has received the official declaration
of war by the combined systems of the Marakan Hegemony. Our response is
simple. Though now as ever we have no interest in conquest, we shall
meet every enemy with strength, every treason with vengeance, every
attack with justice.

And so, however reluctantly, I hereby order Force to commence OPERATION
FIRESTORM: all out war with the Marakan Hegemony. Once more we shall take
up arms against aggression. Once more, our brave men and women shall
pass through the gauntlet of hardship and danger to emerge victorious
and proud. Once more unto the breach, for honor, for courage, and
enduring freedom.

Thank you, and good evening.


BRIEFING 06 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
STRATPLAN BRIEFING
Timestamp: $TIME
Subject: Operation Firestorm
Classified: SECRET R3 NTK

Our strategic plan for Operation Firestorm is to employ the Third and
Fifth Fleets as two arms in a giant pincer maneuver. The Sixth Fleet is
currently deployed in the southern systems. By proceding from Haiche to
Ostara to Tarsus, we have effectively flanked the heavier concentration
of Hegemony firepower in the Kolchev system. The Seventh Fleet is
already in Silessia on its way to the Loris system in the north. Once
Loris is secure, the Seventh Fleet will proceed south to Korius and
Adantar. Additional Fleets will then become available to backfill and
secure the territory we have won.

For those of you in the Sixth Fleet, we expect Tarsus to be an easy
victory. The system is isolated and not well defended. However, the
Kolchev system will be no pushover. There is a major Hegemony starbase
in the northern mountains of Lovo Sector on Kolchev, and we expect their
star fleet to fall back and regroup in that system as soon as we begin
to gain the upper hand in Tarsus.

Finally, it looks like we will have to watch out for Zolon involvement
after all. Zolon fighters and cruisers played a key role in eliminating
the peace conference and escalating the war. Unfortunately, we have
very little information on their capabilities. Reports from officers
who engaged them in the Tarsus system suggest that their ships are very
tough and have weapons at least the equal of our own. They also seem
to have developed some new type of faster than light drive. We assume
that is operates on a principle entirely different than our own quantum
drives. Even their smallest fighters have independent FTL capability,
so they can both run and fight.

Well, we have a job to do. Stay sharp out there.


MAIL 01 (Jonas Devlin) New Job
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hey Mate,

Well, it looks like my trade scouting days are officially over. This may
come as some surprise, but I've been working as a Force:Intel field agent
for the past two years. I got recruited at a trader’s conference here
in Thralis. Anyway, after that series of scrapes I went through trying
to get out of the Nephrys system, my boss decided he wanted to keep me
where he could see that I was in one piece. So he kicked me upstairs
and made me an Analyst in Third Directorate. Now I just get to read the
kinds of reports I used to submit.

I guess I'm not that surprised to hear the Zolons have gotten actively
involved in the fight. The Nephrys system was crawling with them when I
was out there. It seems to be their main hangout in Hegemony space. Still,
something seems really off about the "phony peace treaty" ruse. I can't
put my finger on it, but something doesn't add up.

Good luck, mate. Watch your back out there.

\--Jonas


BRIEFING 07 (Jonas Devlin) Loris Collapse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Intel field agents report that the system is in a state of
near-anarchy. Hegemony military losses sustained during Operation Shining
Fortress have eroded popular support for the government. New demands
to defend the system for Operation Firestorm have strained resources to
the breaking point.

The Brotherhood of Iron criminal organization saw this an opportunity
to attack. The Loris Trade Secretary was assassinated and replaced, and
trade enforcement was weakened as a result. Brotherhood Marauders and
Raiders began preying on traffic in the outer sectors. Now, fighting has
erupted throughout the entire Loris System. The government has collapsed,
and Hegemony military units are attempting to control the political
situation and deal with the pirates at the same time.

It is unfortunate that we cannot wait for this local conflict to burn
itself out before we invade the Loris system. Unfortunately, Force Seventh
Fleet needs to get to the Korius system to complete the pincer strategy
or the Sixth Fleet will be trapped in hostile territory. Taking control
of the Loris system is quickest way to achieve that goal. And that means
that both the pirates and the Hegemony warships are legal targets.


NEWS 08 Masil Gannet
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TANIS FIELD COMMAND CENTER, ADANTAR -

The Tanis Field Command Center is very well secured. Only true Dantari
are ever allowed within the secret location, and only those of the inmost
circle are permitted any knowledge of its location on Adantar. Rare
visitors from the outside are brought to and from the command center in
a state of suspended animation, and are rigorously checked for hidden
recording devices and location transponders. Automatic weapons are kept
trained on visitors at all times.

Such is the atmosphere that surrounds the Warlord Masil Gannet. The former
Solusan Senator returned to the world of his ancestors following a failed
political movement to ally Solus with nearby Renser Prefecture. When he
arrived here, he found the Ulset Nar political organization, originally
founded by his grandfather, in a state of disarray. Gannet quickly used
his wealth and political connections among ultra conservative Dantari to
reform the group and setup a new base of operations in the Tanis Sector.

Under Gannet's leadership, the Ulset Nar group became focused - one
might even say obsessed - with establishing the supremacy of true
ethnic Dantari throughout the Korius system. Although the group claims
to be interested only in peaceful leadership of those willing to follow,
the massive store of weapons in their desert fortress may give a deeper
sense of their true aims.


BRIEFING 09 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Kolchev System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As expected, the Hegemony Third Fleet has fallen back to the Kolchev
system. Once it became clear that they could not contest our control
of Tarsus, they elected to abandon that system in hopes that we could
be drawn into a trap by attacking them where they are well defended. Of
course, being aware of the trap is our first step in evading it.

The Kolchev system will present some unique challenges for Force Sixth
Fleet. Hegemony forces are scattered across four planetary orbits. The
capital Kolchev is the only planet capable of sustaining a human
population. The northern mountains of the Lovo sector on Kolchev are
home to a significant military presence.

Taking control of the Kolchev system will require us to choose
our battles. Always engage the enemy where we can muster a local
tactical advantage, and be prepared to withdraw to protect your ships
if necessary. Remember that the Hegemony forces have the advantage of
local supplies, while we are stretched across half the Blue Drift region.

Good luck.


MAIL 02 (Sara Hunter) Something You Need to Know
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hello,

Councilor Auris just left here to return home to Ele'aan space. The
Consulate Center feels really strange with no ambassador here. He said
it was just a routine trip, but I have a feeling he isn't planning on
coming back. Now that he has convinced the President that the Zolons
are behind this whole war, I think he feels like his job is done here.

But there's more - something else you need to know. I'm afraid to discuss
it on an open channel like this; I don't know who else might have access
to the fleet mail feed. I think it might be really important, I don't
know. I wish I could see you face to face. I'm afraid to just sit on
this information, and I don't know who else I can trust.

I just need someone to tell me that we are all doing the right thing...

Love from
Sara


BRIEFING 10 (Vice Admiral Caldott) Korius System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As you know, the Korian System consists of two major planets surrounded
by a sparse outer asteroid belt. The outer planet, Rhomin, is a medium
gas giant with several large moons. Two of these moons sustain human
populations. The larger inhabited moon is Korius, the system capital. The
smaller moon is Adantar, a cold desert with a thin atmosphere.

Adantar is the homeworld of the ethnic Dantari who started the Solusan
conflict. In fact, there are reliable reports that the Separatist leader
Masil Gannet has returned to Adantar and established himself as a local
warlord. Although Adantar itself is heavily armed, we do not have any
good data on the strength of space forces in the Korian system. It does
not seem likely that Masil Gannet would be able to construct a new navy
in the short period of time he has been in this system. At the same time,
we should not underestimate his financial reserves. With that kind of
personal wealth comes power and the political connections to achieve
many ends.


END 1 – VICTORY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Hegemony systems Kolchev and Korius have agreed to an unconditional
cease fire.

Force:Ground Special Ops have captured Masil Gannet's headquarters in
the Tanis sector on Adantar, and recovered Gannet's body. It is believed
that he was assassinated by his own forces just prior to the final raid.

Force:Intel field agents have begun searching both planets for evidence
of either technite processing or the stolen Borovan artifact. Now that
we have military control of these systems, it is only a matter of time
before this evidence is found.


END 2 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Firestorm has collapsed. The Hegemony Third Fleet has gained
a tactical advantage over the Force:Space Expeditionary Force in the
southern systems.

The Alliance has sustained devastating losses in these attacks and has
been forced to withdraw. The Sixth Fleet is attempting to fall back
to safe positions within Alliance controlled space. Reinforcements are
being called up from the home systems. With luck, they will arrive in
time to hold off the Hegemony counter invasion and force a settlement.


END 3 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Firestorm has collapsed. The combined Hegemony and Dantari
forces have proven too much for the Alliance Seventh Fleet in the Korian
system. With the failure of the northern advance, the Alliance Sixth
Fleet has become isolated in the Kolchev system and is bound to fall in
a matter of hours.

Reinforcements are being called up from the home systems. With luck,
they will arrive in time to hold off the Hegemony counterstrike and
force a settlement.


Campaign 5
----------

BRIEFING 01 (Fleet Admiral A. Evars) Operation Nightfall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I know that Admiral Caldott usually does these briefings, but this
situation is unusual. I wanted to make it clear to everyone that
this information is coming from the highest possible authority. Also,
please notice that the briefing classification has been increased to
the maximum-security level - TS/R7.

To state the matter succinctly, Operation Firestorm was not the strategic
success we once believed it to be. Force:Intel field agents have been
searching the occupied Hegemony systems for months, looking for any sign
of either the Haichan Technite or the Borovan Archaelith. Until recently
they had come up completely dry. There had been no evidence that any of
the missing contraband had ever been within the borders of either Korius
or Kolchev.

Last week, we got our first break. Traces of Technite were found at
a customs depot in Volova sector, Kolchev. The trace deposits did not
appear to have been further refined, and there was still no sign of the
Borovan Archaelith. Force:Intel agents employed heightened interrogation
methods on the customs personnel to determine that the Technite had
already been shipped out of Kolchev to the Garrison system.

Garrison is a major military stronghold for the Hegemony, only two jumps
away from the Marak system itself. We believe that if the Technite was
sent there, the Borovan Archaelith must also be on its way. We cannot
estimate how long we have before the Hegemony will be able to produce
a Quantum Disruptor weapon system.

We are therefore commencing Operation Nightfall to recover the artifacts
from the Garrison system. Our first task is to gain control of the
Radix and Isham star systems. Force First Fleet will take the northern
route and secure the Isham system, while Second Fleet flanks them to
the south through the Radix system. Our combined forces must converge
on the Garrison system as soon as they can manage it.

This will not be an easy task. We need maximum effort from every member
of Force involved in this campaign. Good luck.


NEWS 02 Garden
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TIGER BAY, GARDEN - Named for the manta-like Tiger Mara that inhabit
its warm coastal waters, the Tiger Bay Colony is today a thriving
metropolis. Tiger Bay was once the original landing site for the Garden
colonists. In the intervening years, a carefully managed urban sprawl has
decorated the bright sands and azure waters of the bay. Glittering office
towers and trendy entertainment venues share the tree-lined avenues of
the mainland beach cities, while more relaxed appointments decorate the
myriad offshore islands.

Just offshore, the littoral waters are dotted with thermal power rigs. In
addition to the thermal energy that powers the cities of Tiger Bay,
these isolated platforms have tapped into the deep underground pockets
of gas that have become a key export for the Isham system.


NEWS 03 Radix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RADIX - The Radix system is a small province on the southern edge of
Marakan territory. The system has always been poor in natural resources
and as a result has never been able to develop the economic influence of
its larger northern neighbors. But with the conclusion of last month's
trade conference, it has become clear that the Radix government is
seeking to change all of that.

Over the past few decades, the main trade path in the area has been the
Garrison/Isham/Kolchev/Tarsus loop. As those systems have prospered,
trade taxes have risen along with the increased traffic. At the trade
conference, the Radix Minister for Commerce introduced a bold new
super-low tariff policy designed to entice crossroads traffic between
Garrison and Kolchev as well as Isham and Tarsus to pass through Radix
instead of traveling 'around the horn. '


NEWS 04 Politics Back Home
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ALLIANCE CAPITAL, JARNELL – As the war moves farther away from the
Terellian core systems and as losses on both sides continue to mount,
political action groups are increasing calls for a negotiated settlement
and the return of Force to the Terellian home systems. A rally held
before the Senate Building on Jarnell this morning typifies the emotional
rhetoric of the growing pacifist movement:

"For how much longer will our young men and women be asked to fight and
die hundreds of parsecs from their homes?  When and how will this insane
quest finally come to an end?  We've been very patient with Valmar for
the past ten months as he has led our entire system on a wild goose
chase. But it is obvious now that he has key Senate sub-committees in
his hip pocket," said one rally organizer.

Chants of "We want our government back!  We want our children back!
We want peace back!  And we want them back now!" echoed through the
Senate Plaza until security officers were forced to disperse the crowd.

Central to the pacifist movement are the growing questions regarding the
mysterious disappearance of the Borovan Archaelith and the inability
of Force:Intel to locate large stores of Haichan Technite that were
believed to be at the heart of the war. Without concrete evidence, it
is becoming more and more difficult for many civilians to support what
they view as simple expansionism.


BRIEFING 06 (Admiral Caldott) Geothermal Platforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
STRATPLAN BRIEFING
Timestamp: 03/21:00:00
Subject: Tiger Bay Geothermal Platforms
Classified: SECRET R2 NTK

Strategic Planning has been reviewing the situation on Garden for the past
fifteen hours. The planet is wealthy and heavily populated. This means
that the risk of unintended collateral damage is very high. It also means
that Garden has the resources to hold off an attack for quite a while.

Our best option at this point seems to be the geothermal energy platforms
just offshore from the cities surrounding Tiger Bay. Disabling these
platforms will cut most of the power to the bay cities, and will also
interrupt the colony's main planetary export, with a minimum rate of
civilian casualties.

The goal here is to convert the Isham system to a defensive posture so
that our forces can move on to more important targets in the Garrison
system.


BRIEFING 07 (Jonas Devlin) Deadman’s Alley
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The latest information we have is that the Hegemony has abandoned their
pre-war military outpost in the northern canyons and set up a newer base
to the south and east. My team was in the Radix system several months
ago - just prior to Operation Shining Fortress - and we were able to
contact some local smugglers before making the jump to Tarsus on the
way back home.

The local smugglers call the new base "Deadman's Alley" and that sounds
accurate enough. They have a starbase flight strip and several barracks
tucked away in a narrow passage of Shadow Canyon. The base is protected
by several AAA and SAM emplacements. The problem for an aerial attack is
that the canyons are so narrow they will make it hard for our pilots to
evade ground fire on the way in to the strike zone. The only good news
is that the canyon walls also make for decent protection if you can keep
your package below the rim wall.

Stay alert down there if you want to make it back in one piece.


BRIEFING 08 (Admiral Caldott) Ramek Station
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While the Orion CVBG has been occupied in Garden, our cruiser and
destroyer squadrons in Senesca have been keeping the enemy very busy. Most
of the remaining Hegemony fleet in Isham has pulled out of Senesca at
this time. They are apparently headed to Ramek sector to regroup.

Ramek is a medium gas giant planet with nothing terribly remarkable
in the way of moons or other resources. The Isham system maintains a
standard Type 4 station there, similar to the outpost we discovered in
Ostara. We believe they have a complement of Avenger strike fighters in
rotation there, so we will need the Orion CVBG to run interference for
our cruiser groups.

If we can reduce Ramek Station and its attached fighter wing, we believe
that we can pin the Hegemony carrier group here in Isham. They will not
be able to follow us to the Garrison system if their other key defenses
have been shattered.


BRIEFING 09 (Kash Anlon) Garrison Station
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Force:Intel has traced the illegal Technite to an Hegemony military
laboratory in orbit about the planet Garrison. The Garrison system
has always been a major storehouse for the Hegemony military, and this
station is going to be no pushover. The station is armored, shielded,
and has as much firepower as several heavy cruisers. In particular,
watch out for the gamma ray laser turrets mounted on either side of the
central manufacturing sector.

About the only good news is that there is no fighter capability in the
system. None of the planets are habitable, and the Garrison Military
Laboratory is only designed to accommodate large starships. You will of
course need to stay alert for carrier-based fighter craft in the region.


MAIL 01 (Sara Hunter) Incommunicado
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Hello,

I'm sorry I haven't written you in so long. I hope you'll accept my lame
apology, as I don't even have a lame excuse!  The Ele'aan Consulate
is an absolute madhouse. Councilor Auris hasn't returned from the
Ele'aan homeworld, and no replacement for him has been sent. We've been
requesting an update from the Ele'aan leadership for weeks, but we can't
get a straight answer from them (not that there's anything unusual about
[that]).

*[beginning to panic]* Finally this morning, everything just went to
hell. Our communications line to the Ele'aan homeworld has gone completely
dead. Half the computer systems in the consulate have gone dead - I'm
posting this letter from my personal system, which seems unaffected so far
- and all kinds of critical files and databases have been deleted somehow.

*[composing herself, but still desperate]* Wish you were here right now,
I really need to talk to someone I can trust. Sometimes I think you’re
the only one I can rely on.

I’m worried something has gone wrong.
Very wrong.

BRIEFING 10 (Kash Anlon) Trocanther Biodomes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The planet Volante in the Trocanther System is "the front door" to
the Marakan Hegemony, and it is about the most inhospitable place you
could care to find anywhere in space. The surface is hotter than a blast
furnace, and the atmosphere is highly toxic and corrosive as well. The
ceramic composite armor of our fighter craft should be able to withstand
the punishing conditions as long as they aren't exposed for too long.

Believe it or not, people actually live on this forsaken rock. Volante's
crust is a storehouse of rare minerals, and so a few hardy souls have set
up a small colony to exploit them. The ground sector is rather colorfully
named "Hell's Kitchen", and it has a handful of pressurized biodomes for
human habitation. There are also the usual power reactors and support
structures needed to keep the domes cool and breathable on the inside.


BRIEFING 12 (Fleet Admiral A. Evars) Endgame
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Nightfall is coming rapidly to a conclusion. The Hegemony forces
in Trocanther are falling apart; they are not going to last much longer
against the combined attack of our First and Second star fleets. You have
all done an excellent job, and you should be proud of yourselves. You have
fought with honor and integrity, and you have earned the respect of the
entire Force, to say nothing of our government, and the folks back home.

Our latest intel is that we have accounted for almost all of the
Technite. Most of it was destroyed along with the Garrison Military Lab,
and the rest we believe was due to be processed in the biodome factories
on Volante here in Trocanther.

The only thing that is still missing is the Borovan Archaelith. Our
contacts in the Ele'aan Fusion have informed us that the Hegemony may
have taken the Archaelith back to the Marak Prime System. Even without the
Technite, they could still use the Archaelith against us in the future.

Therefore, the President has asked us to take this fight all the way
to Marak, to pressure the Hegemony leadership into surrendering the
Archaelith and signing a non-agression pact. We have come a long way
from home and comfort to do a job. Just a little farther, and we will be
done. I'm asking you all to hang tough for just a few more hours. Let's
get in there, do the job, and go home.

Thank you all.


MAIL 02 (Sara Hunter) Final Message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I don't have very much time. I had to leave Jarnell in a hurry, can't
say where I am or where I'm going. People started disappearing from the
Ele'aan Consulate a week ago. One at a time, they just... weren't
there anymore. I figured I'd better disappear too, while I still had
the chance to decide how and when. I don't know what is going to happen,
or when I'll see you again. Or even [if] I'll see you again.

I don't think I can trust Jonas anymore, or I'd go find him. But I had
to tell someone, and I figured you might at least understand. Might at
least try to do something without letting them trace the information
back to me...

This whole war has been a sham from the beginning. The Zolons and
Hegemony don't have the Borovan Archaelith - they never did. I took it
from the museum myself the night the museum was destroyed. That was the
real reason the Ele'aan Fusion went to the Borovan System - to get to
the Archaelith first, before it could fall into Zolon hands.

The next day, I gave it to Councilor Auris and he took it with him back
to Ele'aas. I can't understand why President Valmar would claim that the
Fusion backed up his reasons for pursuing this conflict. We can't need
the Marakan border worlds that badly, and I can't see a reason why he
would want to stir up trouble with the Zolon Empire.

I don't have very much time. I could be discovered at any moment. I need
to keep moving. Promise me you'll stay safe, OK?

Love from
Sara


BRIEFING 15 (Fleet Admiral A. Evars) Disappearance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Well, obviously this has not gone as we had planned.

As far as we can tell, the Zolon Empire has completely annihilated the
human population of the Marak System. Every Marakan warship and civilian
vessel we have encountered has been found drifting dead in space. There is
no sign of intelligent life anywhere on the planet's surface. Everywhere
we turn there are only more Zolons.

Until today, that is. A few hours ago, every Zolon ship within sensor
range disappeared. We believe that they simply used their peculiar
FTL drives to go home, back to the core Zolon systems, wherever those
are. Frankly, if that is the case, we are lucky this stopped when it
did. Their weapon systems are far more powerful than we could have thought
possible. They took a devastating toll on our forces in just a few days.

At this point, we seem to be out of options. President Valmar has recalled
all of our remaining fleets back to Alliance space. We are going to
leave a small Force:Intel detachment here to try to search Marak Prime
for some evidence of the Borovan Archaelith, or at least some clue as to
why the Zolon Empire chose this moment to decimate the human population
here. The Zolon Empire may not view the distinction between the Alliance
and the Hegemony with the same gravity that we do. It is possible that
they have decided to wipe out all humans in the Blue Drift region.

For now, we are going to continue to run patrols to look for survivors,
but I expect that we will all be shipping out within the next forty hours.

For the time being, please remember that everything that has happened
in the past ten days is classified TOP SECRET R7/NTK. If any members
of the press approach you, refer them to your superior officers, or to
my office directly. I'm sure there will be a board of inquiry convened
when we get back, and we want to keep the unfounded rumors to a minimum
until they have completed their investigation.

Thank you all.


END 1 – VICTORY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Nightfall has ended. The Marakan Hegemony is no more. Trapped
between the advance of the Terellian Alliance and the onslaught of the
Zolon Empire, the culture spawned by the last descendents of Emperor Marak
I has been extinguished like a candle in the darkness between the stars.

The Terellian Alliance has suffered historic losses while achieving
their most profound victory. The Alliance has become the only remaining
human super power in the Blue Drift region. They now face the long work
of rebuilding the independent worlds, even as they prepare to meet the
inevitable return of the Zolon Empire...


END 2 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Nightfall has ended in defeat. Alliance losses in Isham and
Radix have been severe. The President, with the approval of the Combined
Senate, has ordered an immediate withdrawal of all Force units from the
Isham-Radix Theater of Operations.

With the devastating losses on both sides, it seems likely that the
war between the Alliance and the Hegemony is destined for a long and
bloody stalemate.


END 3 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Nightfall has ended in defeat. Alliance losses in the Garrison
System have been severe. The President, with the approval of the Combined
Senate, has ordered an immediate withdrawal of all Force units from
Hegemony controlled space.

With the devastating losses on both sides, it seems likely that the
war between the Alliance and the Hegemony is destined for a long and
bloody stalemate.


END 4 – DEFEAT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Nightfall has ended in defeat. Alliance losses in the Trocanther
System have been severe. The President, with the approval of the Combined
Senate, has ordered an immediate withdrawal of all Force units from
Hegemony controlled space.

With the devastating losses on both sides, it seems likely that the
war between the Alliance and the Hegemony is destined for a long and
bloody stalemate.
