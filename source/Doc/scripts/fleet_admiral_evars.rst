NEWS 03 Blockade Broken (Interview Quote)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TRELLIS - The Alliance Third Fleet has broken the blockade of the
Trellis-Solus Farcaster network, a Force:Command spokesperson has
announced. The minefields surrounding the Farcaster terminus have been
cleared, and several Separatist squadrons have been eliminated or greatly
reduced in strength.

Theater commander Admiral Evars has given official authorization for the
commencement of humanitarian aid traffic to the inner planets. Certified
non-governmental agencies delivering food, clothing, medicines, and
emergency equipment will receive protective escorts by warships from
the Third Fleet.

"Although the blockade has been broken, there are still several hostile
squadrons in operation near the outer worlds. We strongly recommend that
only emergency traffic be routed through the Trellis sector. Civilian
ships are advised to avoid the area until the threat can be assessed
and appropriate actions taken," Evars was quoted as saying.


NEWS 07 Research Lab (Interview Quote)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
MERIDIAN - The Tal Vesta University Stellar Observatory in Meridian orbit
has been cut off by Separatist patrols and is facing severe shortages
of food and consumable supplies. University staff indicate that the
fusion plant on the observatory is still operational, and that basic
life support functions - water, air, and power - are not an immediate
concern. "Mainly, the students are just hungry. And frustrated," said
Research Coordinator Alen Tolap.

Student researchers living at the observatory are protesting the ongoing
civil war. Native Solusans, ethnic Dantari, and even many Terellian
Alliance students have issued a joint statement condemning the conflict
and demanding the resumption of peaceful negotiations. Thus far, neither
party in the conflict has commented on the student protests.

Alliance Theater Command has promised to make humanitarian aid to the
Meridian sector a top priority. "We'll find a way to feed these kids,"
Fleet Admiral Evars was quoted as saying. "There's nothing more ornery
than a bunch of hungry college students. "


NEWS 01 Campaign Start (Interview Quote)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
JARNELL - Just four local months after the success of Operation
Highland, the Terellian Alliance has once more been plunged into violent
conflict. For the first time in its five hundred year history, enemy
forces have invaded core Alliance systems and attacked civilian ships
and property.

"Using the Force involvement in the Solusan-Renser Conflict as a pretext,
two key systems within the Marakan Hegemony have formally declared war
on the people of the Terellian Alliance," Force:Space Fleet Commander
A. Evars was quoted as saying.


NEWS 01 Campaign Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
JARNELL - The ink is barely dry on the cease-fire order that brought a
halt to Operation Shining Fortress but Alliance Force starships are once
again being sent into harm's way. The Sixth Fleet left Force Yards in
Jarnell several days ago, and after proceeding along the southern route
through recently-liberated Haiche, has begun operations in the Hegemony
border system of Ostara.

Force officials have so far downplayed the importance of this fleet
engagement. "Shortly before the war began, long range scouts detected a
secret Hegemony base in the Ostara system, near the planet Aram. In the
interest of establishing a safe buffer zone for the Haiche Protectorate,
we are taking this opportunity to encourage those forces to return to
the core Hegemony worlds," Force:Space Fleet Commander A. Evars was
quoted as saying.

Independent military analysts at the prestigious Wiggen Institute
think-tank have observed that another Alliance fleet is also being
prepared in the Paragon system. "Having two additional expeditionary
fleets in operation right now strongly suggests that Force is preparing
for a wider conflict in the near future," said Chu Vo of the institute.

Force:Command joint chiefs declined to comment on speculations that a
major offensive was being planned against the middle Hegemony systems. "I
have no information on that subject that I can share with you at the
present time," said Evars.


BRIEFING 01 (Fleet Admiral A. Evars) Operation Nightfall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I know that Admiral Caldott usually does these briefings, but this
situation is unusual. I wanted to make it clear to everyone that
this information is coming from the highest possible authority. Also,
please notice that the briefing classification has been increased to
the maximum-security level – TS-R7.

To state the matter succinctly, Operation Firestorm was not the strategic
success we once believed it to be. Force:Intel field agents have been
searching the occupied Hegemony systems for months, looking for any sign
of either the Haichan Technite or the Borovan Archaelith. Until recently
they had come up completely dry. There had been no evidence that any of
the missing contraband had ever been within the borders of either Korius
or Kolchev.

Last week, we got our first break. Traces of Technite were found at
a customs depot in Volova sector, Kolchev. The trace deposits did not
appear to have been further refined, and there was still no sign of the
Borovan Archaelith. Force:Intel agents employed heightened interrogation
methods on the customs personnel to determine that the Technite had
already been shipped out of Kolchev to the Garrison system.

Garrison is a major military stronghold for the Hegemony, only two jumps
away from the Marak system itself. We believe that if the Technite was
sent there, the Borovan Archaelith must also be on its way. We cannot
estimate how long we have before the Hegemony will be able to produce
a Quantum Disruptor weapon system.

We are therefore commencing Operation Nightfall to recover the artifacts
from the Garrison system. Our first task is to gain control of the
Radix and Isham star systems. Force First Fleet will take the northern
route and secure the Isham system, while Second Fleet flanks them to
the south through the Radix system. Our combined forces must converge
on the Garrison system as soon as they can manage it.

This will not be an easy task. We need maximum effort from every member
of Force involved in this campaign. Good luck.


BRIEFING 12 (Fleet Admiral A. Evars) Endgame
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Operation Nightfall is coming rapidly to a conclusion. The Hegemony forces
in Trocanther are falling apart; they are not going to last much longer
against the combined attack of our First and Second star fleets. You have
all done an excellent job, and you should be proud of yourselves. You have
fought with honor and integrity, and you have earned the respect of the
entire Force, to say nothing of our government, and the folks back home.

Our latest intel is that we have accounted for almost all of the
Technite. Most of it was destroyed along with the Garrison Military Lab,
and the rest we believe was due to be processed in the biodome factories
on Volante here in Trocanther.

The only thing that is still missing is the Borovan Archaelith. Our
contacts in the Ele'aan Fusion have informed us that the Hegemony may
have taken the Archaelith back to the Marak Prime System. Even without the
Technite, they could still use the Archaelith against us in the future.

Therefore, the President has asked us to take this fight all the way
to Marak, to pressure the Hegemony leadership into surrendering the
Archaelith and signing a non-aggression pact. We have come a long way
from home and comfort to do a job. Just a little farther, and we will be
done. I'm asking you all to hang tough for just a few more hours. Let's
get in there, do the job, and go home.

Thank you all.


BRIEFING 15 (Fleet Admiral A. Evars) Disappearance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*[somewhat wry and chagrined]*
Well, obviously this has not gone as we had planned.

*[becoming more serious, and gaining momentum]*
As far as we can tell, the Zolon Empire has completely annihilated the
human population of the Marak System. Every Marakan warship and civilian
vessel we have encountered has been found drifting dead in space. There is
no sign of intelligent life anywhere on the planet's surface. Everywhere
we turn there are only more Zolons.

Until today, that is. A few hours ago, every Zolon ship within sensor
range disappeared. We believe that they simply used their peculiar
FTL drives to go home, back to the core Zolon systems, wherever those
are. Frankly, if that is the case, we are lucky this stopped when it
did. Their weapon systems are far more powerful than we could have thought
possible. They took a devastating toll on our forces in just a few days.

At this point, we seem to be out of options. President Valmar has recalled
all of our remaining fleets back to Alliance space. We are going to
leave a small Force:Intel detachment here to try to search Marak Prime
for some evidence of the Borovan Archaelith, or at least some clue as to
why the Zolon Empire chose this moment to decimate the human population
here. The Zolon Empire may not view the distinction between the Alliance
and the Hegemony with the same gravity that we do. It is possible that
they have decided to wipe out all humans in the Blue Drift region.

For now, we are going to continue to run patrols to look for survivors,
but I expect that we will all be shipping out within the next forty hours.

For the time being, please remember that everything that has happened in
the past ten days is classified TOP SECRET R7 – Need to Know. If any
members of the press approach you, refer them to your superior officers,
or to my office directly. I'm sure there will be a board of inquiry
convened when we get back, and we want to keep the unfounded rumors to
a minimum until they have completed their investigation.

Thank you all.
